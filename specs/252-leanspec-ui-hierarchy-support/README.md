# LeanSpec UI - Foundational Hierarchy Display

> **Status**: planned · **Priority**: medium · **Created**: 2026-01-29

## Overview

Spec 250 introduces structured hierarchy management for LeanSpec. This spec provides the **foundational UI components** for visualizing and displaying these hierarchical relationships in the web interface.

**Scope**: Read-only display and visualization. Editing capabilities are handled by [253-unified-relationships-editing](../253-unified-relationships-editing/README.md).

Without these foundational components:
- Users cannot visualize spec hierarchy in the UI
- No way to see parent-child relationships in spec cards
- Board view cannot group specs by parent umbrella
- Missing visual indicators for umbrella specs

## Design

### UI Components Needed

**1. Hierarchy Tree Component**
- Visual tree view for spec parent-child relationships
- Expandable/collapsible nodes
- Shows spec status badges inline
- Depth-based indentation

**2. Spec Card Enhancement**
- Parent indicator on spec cards
- "Children" count badge
- Umbrella icon (🌂) for umbrella specs
- Breadcrumb navigation showing parent chain

**3. Board View Grouping**
- Group specs by parent umbrella
- Nested structure showing hierarchy
- Visual indentation for child specs
- Filter by parent umbrella

**4. Spec Detail View Updates**
- Parent spec section with link
- Children list section
- Hierarchy path breadcrumb
- "View in hierarchy" action

**5. Specs Nav Sidebar Tree-View**
- Replace or augment flat spec list with hierarchical tree
- Expandable/collapsible umbrella specs
- Visual tree connectors showing parent-child relationships
- Indentation levels for nested specs
- Quick expand/collapse all toggle
- Filter/search within tree structure
- Current spec highlighting in tree context
- Drag-and-drop support for re-parenting (future)

### Technical Approach

- Extend existing SpecCard component
- Create new HierarchyTree component
- Update Board view to support grouping
- Add parent/children data to spec queries

## Plan

- [x] Create `HierarchyTree` component with tree visualization
- [x] Update `SpecCard` to show parent and children indicators
- [x] Add umbrella icon indicator for umbrella specs
- [x] Update Board view with "group by parent" option
- [x] Update Spec detail view with parent/children sections
- [x] Add hierarchy breadcrumb navigation
- [x] Update GraphQL queries to fetch parent/children data
- [x] Add TypeScript types for parent-child relationships
- [x] Style updates for visual hierarchy indicators
- [x] Implement Specs Nav Sidebar with tree-view mode

## Test

- [x] Hierarchy tree renders correctly with nested specs
- [x] Spec cards show parent link when applicable
- [x] Umbrella specs display umbrella icon
- [x] Board grouping by parent works as expected
- [x] Spec detail shows parent and children sections
- [x] Breadcrumb navigation works across hierarchy levels
- [x] Specs nav sidebar tree-view displays hierarchy correctly
- [x] Expand/collapse works for umbrella specs in sidebar

## Notes

### Relationship to Sibling Specs

This is part of the **spec 250 hierarchy management** initiative:

| Spec           | Focus             | Scope                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **252 (this)** | Foundational UI   | Read-only display, visualization, tree components |
| **253**        | Optimized UI      | Unified editing experience (builds on 252)        |
| **254**        | Optimized CLI/MCP | Streamlined `rel` command interface               |

### Related Work

- **250-structured-spec-hierarchy-management** - Core backend/MCP implementation
- Requires updated GraphQL schema with parent/children fields
- Umbrella detection is automatic based on having children
