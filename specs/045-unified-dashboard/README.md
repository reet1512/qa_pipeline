# Unified Analytics & Velocity Tracking

> **Status**: ✅ Complete · **Priority**: High · **Created**: 2025-11-04 · **Tags**: ux, visualization, analytics, launch, v0.2.0

**Split into sub-specs for Context Economy** - See detailed sections below

## Overview

Consolidate analytics commands and add velocity tracking to measure SDD effectiveness.

### What Was Built

1. ✅ **Timestamp tracking** → `created_at`, `updated_at`, `completed_at`, `transitions` in frontmatter
2. ✅ **Velocity metrics** → Cycle time, throughput, WIP tracking in `utils/velocity.ts`
3. ✅ **Enhanced stats command** → Added `--velocity`, `--timeline`, `--full` flags
4. ✅ **Board enhancements** → Integrated velocity summary into board view
5. ❌ **Dashboard command** → Not implemented (functionality merged into enhanced `stats` and `board` instead)

### Why Now?

- v0.2.0 launch requires polished, cohesive UX
- Analytics commands overlap in purpose (both show trends/metrics)
- Need single entry point for "show me project health"
- **Velocity is critical metric for SDD adoption** - proves if specs help or hinder

### Before vs After

**Before (v0.1.x):**
```bash
lean-spec stats      # Basic metrics only
lean-spec timeline   # Separate timeline view
lean-spec board      # Basic Kanban
# No velocity tracking
# No timestamp precision
```

**After (v0.2.0):**
```bash
# Enhanced Stats Command
lean-spec stats              # Simplified view with insights
lean-spec stats --timeline   # Add timeline section
lean-spec stats --velocity   # Cycle time analysis
lean-spec stats --full       # Everything combined

# Enhanced Board Command  
lean-spec board              # Now includes velocity summary

# Timeline Command
lean-spec timeline           # Still works (not deprecated)

# Velocity tracking active
# Precise timestamps in frontmatter
```

## Implemented Features

### ✅ 1. Timestamp Tracking (Foundation)
Precise timestamps alongside existing dates enable velocity metrics:
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `completed_at` (ISO 8601) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- Optional `transitions` array for stage duration tracking - **IMPLEMENTED**
- Backward compatible (infer from dates if missing) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- Auto-enrichment on create/update operations - **IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ 2. Velocity Metrics
Comprehensive velocity tracking implemented in `src/utils/velocity.ts`:
- **Cycle Time**: Created → Completed (avg, median, P90) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Lead Time**: Time in each status from transitions - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Throughput**: Specs/week with trend indicators - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **WIP Tracking**: Current and historical WIP averages - **IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ 3. Enhanced Stats Command
Completely redesigned stats command with multiple views:
- `lean-spec stats` → New simplified view with insights (default) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- `lean-spec stats --timeline` → Add timeline section - **IMPLEMENTED**
- `lean-spec stats --velocity` → Show cycle time analysis - **IMPLEMENTED**
- `lean-spec stats --full` → Everything combined (old analytics style) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- Smart insights and completion tracking - **IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ 4. Board Command Enhancements
Integrated velocity metrics into board view:
- Shows velocity summary (cycle time, throughput, WIP) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- Completion rate and project health - **IMPLEMENTED**

### ❌ 5. Dashboard Command (Not Implemented)
Decision: Instead of creating a separate dashboard command, the functionality was distributed:
- Enhanced `stats` command provides comprehensive analytics
- Enhanced `board` command shows velocity summary
- This keeps the CLI simpler and more focused

## Quick Reference

### Command Comparison

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `lean-spec list` | Browse/search specs | Find specific spec, apply filters |
| `lean-spec board` | Kanban workflow + velocity | Sprint planning, project health |
| `lean-spec stats` | Comprehensive analytics | Deep metrics, velocity analysis |
| `lean-spec timeline` | Historical trends | Activity over time |

### Stats Output Examples

**Simplified view (default):**
```bash
lean-spec stats
# Shows: Overview, Status, Priority Focus, Needs Attention, Velocity Summary
```

**Velocity analysis:**
```bash
lean-spec stats --velocity
# Shows: Cycle Time, Lead Time, Throughput, WIP metrics
```

**Full analytics:**
```bash
lean-spec stats --full
# Shows: Everything combined (stats + timeline + velocity)
```

## Sub-Specs

Detailed information split for Context Economy (<400 lines per file):

- **[DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)** - Architecture, timestamp tracking, command structure
- **[RATIONALE.md](./RATIONALE.md)** - Why velocity matters, design decisions, alternatives
- **[IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Step-by-step implementation plan with phases
- **[TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)** - Comprehensive test strategy and success criteria
- **[ACTUAL-IMPLEMENTATION.md](./ACTUAL-IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Final implementation details and outcomes

## Success Criteria (Achieved)

**✅ User Experience:**
- Stats command now provides clear project insights with simplified default view
- Needs Attention section highlights critical issues
- Velocity metrics prove SDD effectiveness
- No breaking changes for existing users

**✅ Technical:**
- Fast render performance with single spec load
- Backward compatible (old stats behavior available with `--full`)
- Clean separation: velocity.ts, completion.ts, insights.ts utilities
- Comprehensive test coverage

**✅ Business:**
- Velocity metrics demonstrate SDD value objectively
- Enhanced board/stats commands improve v0.2.0 launch demo
- Clear analytics for teams to track improvement

## Dependencies

None - standalone feature for v0.2.0

## Implementation Notes

### Why Velocity Metrics Matter

**Velocity is SDD's feedback loop:**
- Proves whether specs accelerate or slow development
- Identifies workflow bottlenecks
- Tracks team learning curve  
- Makes SDD adoption measurable
- Provides objective data for process improvement

### Design Decisions

**Why no separate dashboard command?**
- Decided against `lean-spec` defaulting to dashboard (keeps help accessible)
- Enhanced `stats` and `board` commands provide comprehensive views
- Simpler CLI surface area (fewer commands to learn)
- Functionality distributed where it makes most sense

**Why keep timeline command?**
- Originally planned for deprecation
- Decided to keep it as dedicated historical view
- No user confusion since stats/timeline serve different use cases
- No breaking changes needed

### Future Enhancements

- Custom velocity targets via config
- More granular lead time tracking (by spec type/priority)
- Velocity trend predictions
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV)
- Integration with CI/CD for automated tracking
