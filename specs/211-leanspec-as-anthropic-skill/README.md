# LeanSpec Agent Skill Support

## Overview

### Problem & Motivation

**Agent Skills** is an open standard format (https://agentskills.io) originally developed by Anthropic and now adopted across the AI coding ecosystem by Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Letta, Factory, and others. Skills are SKILL.md files that package instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use.

Currently, users must:
- Configure LeanSpec via MCP server
- Set up AGENTS.md in their project
- Manually teach AI agents about SDD methodology in every conversation

**The Opportunity**: Create a **LeanSpec Agent Skill** (SKILL.md) that:
- Teaches agents the complete SDD workflow automatically
- Works across multiple AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Codex, etc.)
- Makes SDD methodology discoverable and portable
- Serves as an **addon feature**, complementing existing MCP/CLI tools

### What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are a lightweight, open format:
- **SKILL.md file** with frontmatter (name, description) + markdown instructions
- Optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` directories
- **Progressive disclosure**: Agents load name/description first, full content on activation
- **Cross-platform**: Works with Claude, Cursor, Codex, Letta, Factory, and growing list
- **Version controlled**: Skills are just folders you can check into git

**Key principle**: Skills are **addon capabilities**, not a replacement for core tooling.

### Strategic Vision

**Current**: LeanSpec via MCP + CLI + AGENTS.md  
**Future**: LeanSpec Agent Skill for cross-platform SDD methodology

**Key Insight**: SKILL.md serves as **primary onboarding** - teams no longer need massive AGENTS.md files with duplicated SDD instructions.

```

## Scope Clarification

**This Spec (211)**: Creating the **content** of the LeanSpec Agent Skill ✅ COMPLETE
- SKILL.md file structure and content ✅
- Methodology encoding (SDD workflow, context economy, best practices) ✅
- Tool reference documentation (MCP vs CLI) ✅
- References/ directory content (WORKFLOW.md, BEST-PRACTICES.md, EXAMPLES.md, COMMANDS.md) ✅
- Multiple skills created: **leanspec-sdd** (user-facing) + publishing/development (internal) ✅

**Spec 226** (226-agent-skills-init-integration): Automated installation during `lean-spec init`
- Skills folder detection logic
- Interactive installation prompts
- Project-level and user-level installation
- Multi-tool support
- CLI flags for automation

**Spec 222**: Cross-tool **distribution and compatibility** system
- Comprehensive tool detection (all major AI coding tools)
- Platform-specific installation strategies (Windows copy vs macOS/Linux symlink)
- Multi-tool simultaneous installation
- Tool-specific optimizations and adapters
- Version management and sync mechanisms

**Relationship**: 211 creates the skills (DONE), 226 handles init integration, 222 handles advanced cross-tool compatibility.

## High-Level Approach

### 1. Skill Definition Structure

**Agent Skill Format** (SKILL.md):

The skill will have YAML frontmatter followed by markdown instructions:

**Frontmatter fields**:
- `name: leanspec-sdd`
- `description`: Spec-Driven Development methodology for AI-assisted development. Use when working in a LeanSpec project.
- `compatibility`: Requires lean-spec CLI or @leanspec/mcp server
- `metadata`: author, version, homepage

**Body sections**:
1. When to Use This Skill - Triggers for activation (LeanSpec project detected, user mentions specs, planning features)
2. Core SDD Workflow - Discovery (board, search) → Design (create, validate tokens) → Implement (update status) → Validate (check completion)
3. Context Economy Principles - Keep specs under 2000 tokens, validate before creating
4. Tool Reference - Document both MCP tool names and CLI commands
5. Best Practices - Common patterns, anti-patterns, examples

See references/ for detailed workflow steps, examples, and patterns.

### 2. Integration Points

**Foundation (exists)**:
- MCP server: `@leanspec/mcp` with all tools (list, view, create, etc.)
- CLI: `lean-spec` commands
- AGENTS.md: Project-specific instructions

**Agent Skill (new, addon)**:
- SKILL.md file teaching SDD methodology
- References MCP tools and CLI commands
- Portable across Claude, Cursor, Codex, etc.
- Does NOT replace existing tools

### 3. User Experience

**Before (without Agent Skill)**:
```
Project requires 500+ line AGENTS.md explaining:
- SDD workflow
- When to create specs
- Token limits
- Discovery process
- Common patterns

User: "Let's implement feature X"
Agent: "Should I create a spec first?"
User: "Yes, follow SDD methodology in AGENTS.md..."
Agent: [needs to read and parse lengthy AGENTS.md]
```

**After (with Agent Skill)**:
```
AGENTS.md becomes minimal (50-100 lines):
- Project-specific rules only
- Team conventions
- Custom workflows

User: "Let's implement feature X"
Agent: [Detects LeanSpec project, activates leanspec-sdd skill]
Agent: [SKILL.md teaches SDD automatically]
Agent: "Checking existing specs..."
Agent: [Runs lean-spec board and search]
Agent: "No existing spec found. Creating spec 211-feature-x following SDD..."
Agent: [Creates spec, validates <2000 tokens, links dependencies]
Agent: "Spec created. Ready to implement?"
```

**Onboarding Benefit**: New team members don't need to read/maintain massive AGENTS.md. SKILL.md provides standard SOP automatically.

**Cross-platform**: Works with Claude, Cursor, Codex, and any skill-compatible agent.

### 4. What The Skill Teaches

| Capability                | What Agents Learn                                 | Tools Used             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Discovery**             | Always check specs first via board and search     | MCP or CLI             |
| **Context Economy**       | Keep specs <2000 tokens, validate before creating | tokens tool/command    |
| **SDD Workflow**          | Follow: Discover → Design → Implement → Validate  | Documented in SKILL.md |
| **Dependency Management** | Use link/unlink to track relationships            | MCP or CLI             |
| **Quality Gates**         | Validate before marking complete                  | validate tool/command  |
| **Best Practices**        | Common patterns, anti-patterns, spec structure    | Examples in SKILL.md   |
| **Onboarding**            | Standard SOP without requiring AGENTS.md bloat    | SKILL.md as primary    |

**Key Benefit**: SKILL.md serves as **primary onboarding mechanism**. Projects only need minimal AGENTS.md for custom rules.

**Note**: Skill is **methodology teaching**, not tool replacement.

## Out of Scope

**NOT included in this spec** (211):
- ❌ New MCP tools (use existing ones)
- ❌ CLI modifications (skill references existing commands)
- ❌ Desktop app integration (handled by spec 168)
- ❌ Complex workflow orchestration (handled by spec 171)
- ❌ Comprehensive cross-tool compatibility system (handled by spec 222)
- ❌ Platform-specific installation optimization (handled by spec 222)
- ❌ Tool-specific variants and adapters (handled by spec 222)
- ❌ Advanced version management and sync (handled by spec 222)

**Why**: 
- This spec focuses on creating the SKILL.md content and basic installation
- Spec 222 handles the complete cross-tool distribution and compatibility infrastructure
- The Skill teaches methodology; tooling already exists

## Dependencies

**Foundation** (must exist):
- ✅ **@leanspec/mcp** - MCP server package (exists)
- ✅ **MCP tools** - list, view, create, update, etc. (exists)
- ✅ **Token counting** - Spec 069 (complete)
- ✅ **Validation** - Spec 018 (complete)
- ✅ **AI Tool Detection** - Spec 126 (complete) - Used for smart defaults in skill installation

**Related** (coordinated but independent):
- **222-cross-tool-agent-skills-compatibility** - Cross-tool compatibility strategy (planned) - **Critical for installation system**
- **168-leanspec-orchestration-platform** - Desktop app orchestration (parallel)
- **171-burst-mode-orchestrator** - Ralph mode: autonomous iterative development pattern (parallel)
- **123-ai-coding-agent-integration** - Agent dispatch (exists)
- **127-init-agents-merge-automation** - AGENTS.md merge automation (complete)
- **145-mcp-config-auto-setup** - MCP config auto-setup during init (complete)

## Design Considerations

### 1. Agent Skills Format

**Agent Skills specification** (https://agentskills.io/specification):
- **SKILL.md** with YAML frontmatter + Markdown body
- **Progressive disclosure**: name/description loaded first, full content on activation
- **Optional directories**: scripts/, references/, assets/
- **Cross-platform**: Works with any skills-compatible agent

**LeanSpec Skill structure** (example for Claude):
```
.claude/skills/leanspec-sdd/      # Tool-specific location
├── SKILL.md                      # Main skill file
├── references/
│   ├── WORKFLOW.md               # Detailed SDD workflow
│   ├── BEST-PRACTICES.md         # Common patterns
│   └── EXAMPLES.md               # Example specs
└── scripts/
    └── validate-spec.sh          # Optional validation script
```

**Note**: Different tools use different locations (`.github/skills/` for Copilot, `.cursor/skills/` for Cursor, etc.). See spec 222 for complete tool compatibility matrix.

### 2. Agent Skill vs MCP Server

| Aspect            | MCP Server                    | Agent Skill                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Level**         | Low-level tool access         | High-level methodology                      |
| **What**          | Execute commands              | Follow workflow                             |
| **Examples**      | `list`, `create`, `update`    | "Always search first", "Keep <2000 tokens"  |
| **Configuration** | Requires manual setup         | Drop SKILL.md in project or user directory  |
| **Audience**      | Tools with MCP support        | Any Agent Skills-compatible tool            |
| **Adoption**      | Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc. | Claude, Cursor, Codex, Letta, Factory, etc. |

**Strategy**: Skill references MCP/CLI, doesn't replace them. Provides methodology layer.

### 3. SKILL.md vs AGENTS.md: Onboarding Optimization

| Aspect              | Traditional AGENTS.md              | With SKILL.md                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Size**            | 500-1000+ lines                    | 50-100 lines                       |
| **Content**         | SDD workflow + project rules       | Project-specific rules only        |
| **Maintenance**     | Update methodology + project rules | Update project rules only          |
| **Onboarding**      | Read entire AGENTS.md file         | SKILL.md auto-loads                |
| **Portability**     | Project-specific                   | SKILL.md works across projects     |
| **Duplication**     | Every project repeats SDD docs     | SKILL.md shared across projects    |
| **Cross-platform**  | Tool-dependent parsing             | Standard Agent Skills format       |
| **Version Control** | Must sync across projects          | SKILL.md version managed centrally |

**Key Insight**: SKILL.md becomes the **standard SDD SOP**. AGENTS.md shrinks to project-specific customizations only.

**Example AGENTS.md (before SKILL.md)**:
```markdown
# AI Agent Instructions

## LeanSpec SDD Methodology

1. Always check specs first: `lean-spec board`
2. Search before creating: `lean-spec search "query"`
3. Keep specs under 2000 tokens
4. Update status before coding: `--status in-progress`
...
[400+ lines of SDD instructions]

## Project-Specific Rules
- Use pnpm instead of npm
- All UI changes require design review
```

**Example AGENTS.md (with SKILL.md)**:
```markdown
# AI Agent Instructions

## Project: LeanSpec

Lightweight spec methodology for AI-powered development.

**Note**: Core SDD workflow is in `.lean-spec/skills/leanspec-sdd/SKILL.md`

## Project-Specific Rules
- Use pnpm instead of npm
- All UI changes require design review
- Deploy staging before production
```

**Migration Path**: Existing projects can gradually move SDD instructions from AGENTS.md to SKILL.md adoption.

### 4. Methodology Encoding

**SKILL.md structure** (main sections):

1. **When to Use**: Triggers for activating the skill
2. **Core Principles**: Context economy, signal-to-noise, etc.
3. **Discovery Phase**: Always check specs first (board, search)
4. **Design Phase**: Create specs following template, validate tokens
5. **Implementation Phase**: Update status, track progress, document
6. **Validation Phase**: Run validate, check completion criteria
7. **Common Patterns**: Examples of good/bad practices
8. **Tool Reference**: MCP tools and CLI commands available

**Progressive disclosure**:
- SKILL.md: ~300-400 lines (core workflow)
- references/WORKFLOW.md: Detailed step-by-step guide
- references/BEST-PRACTICES.md: Patterns and anti-patterns
- references/EXAMPLES.md: Sample specs

### 5. Skill Location Strategy

**Tool-Specific Locations** (based on spec 222 research):

| AI Tool            | Project-Level     | User-Level           |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/skills/` | `~/.copilot/skills/` |
| **Claude Code**    | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/`  |
| **Cursor**         | `.cursor/skills/` | `~/.cursor/skills/`  |
| **Codex CLI**      | `.codex/skills/`  | `~/.codex/skills/`   |
| **Gemini CLI**     | `.gemini/skills/` | `~/.gemini/skills/`  |
| **VS Code**        | `.vscode/skills/` | `~/.vscode/skills/`  |
| **Generic**        | `.skills/`        | `~/.skills/`         |

**Installation Strategy** (see spec 222 for full details):
- Detect which AI tools are installed
- Offer to install skill to tool-specific location(s)
- Support multiple simultaneous installations
- Windows: copy-based installation (default)
- macOS/Linux: symlink option available

**Scope Recommendations**:
- **Project-Level**: Git-tracked, shared with team, per-project customization
- **User-Level**: Works across all projects, personal preferences

### 6. Skill Discovery & Onboarding Integration

**Critical Feature**: `lean-spec init` must offer to set up agent skills support automatically, detecting existing skills infrastructure and offering appropriate installation options.

#### Common Skills Folder Patterns

Different AI coding tools use different conventions for skills (see spec 222 for complete compatibility matrix):

| AI Tool        | Project-Level Skills | User-Level Skills    | Status   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| Claude         | `.claude/skills/`    | `~/.claude/skills/`  | Common   |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/skills/`    | `~/.copilot/skills/` | Common   |
| Cursor         | `.cursor/skills/`    | `~/.cursor/skills/`  | Common   |
| Codex CLI      | `.codex/skills/`     | `~/.codex/skills/`   | Emerging |
| Gemini CLI     | `.gemini/skills/`    | `~/.gemini/skills/`  | Emerging |
| VS Code        | `.vscode/skills/`    | `~/.vscode/skills/`  | Common   |
| Generic        | `.skills/`           | `~/.skills/`         | Fallback |

**Note**: This spec focuses on creating the SKILL.md content. Spec 222 handles the cross-tool installation system and compatibility details.

#### Detection Strategy

During `lean-spec init`, detect existing skills folders using pattern matching:

**Project-Level Detection** (check in current directory):
- `.github/skills/` (GitHub Copilot convention)
- `.claude/skills/` (Claude Desktop/Code convention)
- `.cursor/skills/` (Cursor IDE convention)
- `.skills/` (Generic fallback)

**User-Level Detection** (check in `~` home directory):
- `~/.copilot/skills/` (GitHub Copilot global)
- `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude global)
- `~/.cursor/skills/` (Cursor global)
- `~/.skills/` (Generic global)

**Detection Logic** (see spec 222 for full implementation with all tools):
```typescript
interface SkillsLocation {
  type: 'project' | 'user';
  path: string;
  tool: 'github' | 'claude' | 'cursor' | 'codex' | 'gemini' | 'vscode' | 'generic';
  exists: boolean;
}

// Simplified example - see spec 222 for complete TOOL_CONFIGS with detection hints
async function detectSkillsLocations(): Promise<SkillsLocation[]> {
  const projectPaths = [
    { path: '.github/skills', tool: 'github' },
    { path: '.claude/skills', tool: 'claude' },
    { path: '.cursor/skills', tool: 'cursor' },
    { path: '.codex/skills', tool: 'codex' },
    { path: '.gemini/skills', tool: 'gemini' },
    { path: '.vscode/skills', tool: 'vscode' },
    { path: '.skills', tool: 'generic' },
  ];
  
  const userPaths = [
    { path: '~/.copilot/skills', tool: 'github' },
    { path: '~/.claude/skills', tool: 'claude' },
    { path: '~/.cursor/skills', tool: 'cursor' },
    { path: '~/.codex/skills', tool: 'codex' },
    { path: '~/.gemini/skills', tool: 'gemini' },
    { path: '~/.vscode/skills', tool: 'vscode' },
    { path: '~/.skills', tool: 'generic' },
  ];
  
  // Check each location for existence
  // Return list of found and potential locations
}
```

#### Onboarding Flow Options

**Scenario 1: No Existing Skills Folders**
```
$ lean-spec init

Welcome to LeanSpec! 🚀

? Which AI tools do you use? (auto-detected)
  ◉ GitHub Copilot
  ◯ Claude Code
  ◯ Cursor

? Install LeanSpec Agent Skill? (Recommended)
  ❯ Yes - Project-level (.github/skills/leanspec-sdd/ for Copilot)
    Yes - User-level (~/.copilot/skills/leanspec-sdd/)
    No - Skip for now

Installing skill to .github/skills/leanspec-sdd/...
  ✓ SKILL.md created
  ✓ references/ directory created
  ✓ Compatible with: GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Codex, and more

💡 Tip: Compatible agents will auto-discover this skill
💡 For other tools, see: lean-spec install-skill --help
```

**Scenario 2: Existing Project Skills Folder Detected**
```
$ lean-spec init

🔍 Detected: .github/skills/ (GitHub Copilot)

? Install LeanSpec skill? (Recommended)
  ❯ Yes - Install to .github/skills/leanspec-sdd/ (for this tool)
    Yes - User-level (~/.copilot/skills/leanspec-sdd/) (for all projects)
    No - Skip for now

Installing to .github/skills/leanspec-sdd/...
  ✓ Skill installed
  ✓ GitHub Copilot will auto-discover on next reload
```

**Scenario 3: Multiple Skills Locations Detected**
```
$ lean-spec init

🔍 Detected existing skills folders:
   • .claude/skills/ (Claude Code)
   • ~/.copilot/skills/ (GitHub Copilot, user-level)

? Where should we install the LeanSpec skill?
  ◉ .claude/skills/leanspec-sdd/ (project, git-tracked, for Claude)
  ◉ ~/.copilot/skills/leanspec-sdd/ (user, all projects, for Copilot)
  ◯ Skip installation

Installing to selected locations...
  ✓ .claude/skills/leanspec-sdd/ created
  ✓ ~/.copilot/skills/leanspec-sdd/ created
```

#### Implementation Approach

**Option A: Copy Skill Files** (Recommended for v1)
- Copy SKILL.md and references/ from bundled template
- Each installation location gets its own copy
- Easy to customize per-project or per-user
- ✅ Simple, no symlink complexity
- ⚠️ Updates require re-copying

**Option B: Symlink to Bundled Skill**
- Create symlink to skill in lean-spec installation
- Single source of truth
- Automatic updates
- ⚠️ Windows compatibility issues
- ⚠️ Breaks if lean-spec uninstalled/moved

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (deferred to spec 222)
- Copy to one tool-specific location as canonical
- Symlink from other tool folders to canonical location
- Single source of truth within project
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ⚠️ Still has Windows symlink issues

**Chosen for v1: Option A (Copy)** - See spec 222 for implementation details
- Simplest to implement
- Works everywhere (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Users can customize per-tool as needed
- Each tool gets its own copy in its preferred location
- Future enhancement: `lean-spec sync-skill` to update from template

#### User-Level vs Project-Level Strategy

**Project-Level Skills** (`.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc.):
- ✅ Git-tracked (team shares same methodology)
- ✅ Version-controlled with project
- ✅ Can customize per-project
- ✅ Tool-specific locations ensure proper discovery
- ⚠️ Requires setup per project

**User-Level Skills** (`~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, etc.):
- ✅ Works across all projects
- ✅ Setup once, use everywhere
- ✅ Personal workflow preferences
- ✅ Tool-specific locations ensure proper discovery
- ⚠️ Not shared with team
- ⚠️ Harder to version control

**Recommendation in init**: Offer both, default to project-level for teams, user-level for individual developers. See spec 222 for complete cross-tool installation strategy.

#### CLI Flags for Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
# Install to detected tool's default location
lean-spec init -y --skill

# Install to specific tool locations
lean-spec init -y --skill-github       # .github/skills/ (GitHub Copilot)
lean-spec init -y --skill-claude       # .claude/skills/ (Claude Code)
lean-spec init -y --skill-cursor       # .cursor/skills/ (Cursor)
lean-spec init -y --skill-codex        # .codex/skills/ (Codex CLI)
lean-spec init -y --skill-gemini       # .gemini/skills/ (Gemini CLI)
lean-spec init -y --skill-vscode       # .vscode/skills/ (VS Code)
lean-spec init -y --skill-user         # Tool-specific user-level location
lean-spec init -y --skill-all          # All detected tool locations

# Skip skill installation
lean-spec init -y --no-skill

#### Integration with AI Tool Detection (Spec 126)

**Leverage Existing Detection**: Reuse the AI tool detection logic from spec 126 to provide smart defaults for skill installation locations.

**Detection-to-Location Mapping**:

| Detected Tool          | Suggest Skills Folder(s)                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Copilot         | `.github/skills/` (project), `~/.copilot/skills/` (user)      |
| Claude Desktop/Code    | `.claude/skills/` (project), `~/.claude/skills/` (user)       |
| Cursor                 | `.cursor/skills/` (project), `~/.cursor/skills/` (user)       |
| Generic (no detection) | `.lean-spec/skills/` (project), `~/.skills/` (user, fallback) |

**Enhanced Onboarding Flow**:
```
$ lean-spec init

🔍 Detected AI tools:
   • GitHub Copilot (github.copilot extension installed)
   • Claude Code (~/.claude directory found)

? Install LeanSpec Agent Skill?
  ❯ Yes - Project-level skills
    Yes - User-level skills (across all projects)
    No - Skip for now

? Where should we install the skill? (Select all that apply)
  ◉ .github/skills/leanspec-sdd/ (for GitHub Copilot)
  ◉ .claude/skills/leanspec-sdd/ (for Claude Code)
  ◯ ~/.copilot/skills/leanspec-sdd/ (user-level, all projects)
  ◯ ~/.claude/skills/leanspec-sdd/ (user-level, all projects)

Installing skill...
  ✓ .github/skills/leanspec-sdd/ created
  ✓ .claude/skills/leanspec-sdd/ created
  
💡 Tip: Restart your AI tools to discover the new skill
```

**Logic**:
1. Run AI tool detection (from spec 126)
2. Map detected tools to recommended skills folders
3. Pre-select those folders in the checkbox prompt
4. Also show generic options (`.lean-spec/skills/`, `~/.skills/`)
5. User can adjust selection before confirming

**Benefits**:
- Zero-config experience for most users
- Intelligent defaults based on actual installed tools
- Still allows manual override/customization
- Consistent with existing onboarding flow

#### Success Indicators

After skill installation, verify:
- ✅ SKILL.md exists in target location(s)
- ✅ references/ directory created with supporting docs
- ✅ File permissions are correct (readable by AI tools)
- ✅ If using symlinks, links are valid

Show helpful message:
```
✓ LeanSpec Agent Skill installed!

Next: Restart your AI coding tool to discover the skill.
      Try asking: "What skills are available?"
      
Compatible tools: GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Codex, and more
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: SKILL.md Creation (1 week) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goals**:
- [x] Create SKILL.md following Agent Skills specification
- [x] Write frontmatter (name, description, compatibility)
- [x] Document core SDD workflow in markdown
- [x] Create references/ directory with detailed docs

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ `.github/skills/leanspec-sdd/SKILL.md` (105 lines)
- ✅ `references/WORKFLOW.md`, `BEST-PRACTICES.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `COMMANDS.md`
- ✅ Additional skills: leanspec-publishing, leanspec-development
- ✅ Scripts directory with validate-spec.sh

### Phase 2: Tool Integration (3-5 days) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goals**:
- [x] Document MCP tool usage in skill
- [x] Provide CLI command alternatives
- [x] Add examples of both approaches
- [x] Test with different agent tools

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Clear tool reference section in SKILL.md with MCP/CLI mapping table
- ✅ Compatibility notes in frontmatter
- ✅ References/COMMANDS.md with detailed tool usage

### Phase 3: Onboarding Integration → MOVED TO NEW SPEC

**Note**: This phase has been split into a separate spec for automated installation integration during `lean-spec init`.

**Moved to new spec**:
- Skills folder detection logic
- Installation prompts in init command
- Project-level and user-level installation
- Multi-tool detection and selection
- CLI flags for non-interactive mode
- Cross-platform installation (Windows/macOS/Linux)

**Why split**: 
- Skill content creation (this spec) is complete and usable
- Installation automation is a separate concern requiring CLI/Rust changes
- Users can manually copy skills to their projects today
- Automated installation enhances UX but isn't blocking

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement → PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- [x] Measure token count of SKILL.md (105 lines, well under 500 target) ✅
- [x] Test skill structure and format ✅
- [x] Verify progressive disclosure (main SKILL.md + detailed references/) ✅

**Ongoing** (continuous improvement):
- Test with real LeanSpec projects (happening organically)
- Gather feedback from different agent tools
- Iterate on methodology encoding based on usage

**Moved to installation spec**:
- Onboarding flow test scenarios
- Multi-tool installation testing

### Phase 5: Distribution → PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- [x] Skills bundled in repository (`.github/skills/`) ✅
- [x] Version controlled and shareable ✅

**Future work** (post-automated-installation):
- [ ] Create setup documentation (after automation complete)
- [ ] Submit to community skill repositories
- [ ] Announce availability
- [ ] Blog post showcasing skills-based onboarding

| **Onboarding time**     | <5 min to understand SDD (vs 30+ min)   | User feedback                      |

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Agent Behavior Variance

**Issue**: Different agents may interpret skills differently.

**Mitigation**:
1. Follow Agent Skills specification strictly
2. Test with multiple agents (Claude, Cursor, Codex)
3. Use clear, explicit instructions in SKILL.md
4. Provide examples in references/

### Challenge 2: Tool Detection

**Issue**: Skill needs to detect if MCP or CLI is available.

**Mitigation**:
- Document both MCP and CLI approaches in skill
- Include compatibility field in frontmatter
- Provide graceful degradation instructions

### Challenge 3: Methodology Drift

**Issue**: Agents might not consistently follow skill instructions.

**Mitigation**:
- Strong, explicit workflow instructions
- Include "When to Use" section
- Provide positive/negative examples
- Continuous refinement based on usage

## Open Questions

1. **Should we bundle the skill with lean-spec installation?**
   - Or distribute separately via GitHub?
   - Pros/cons of each approach
   - **Answer**: Yes, bundle with installation for seamless onboarding

2. **How do we handle skill updates?**
   - Version in metadata field
   - Migration path for existing users
   - Consider `lean-spec sync-skill` command to update from template

3. **What's the best skill location?**
   - Project-level (.lean-spec/skills/)?
   - User-level (~/.codex/skills/)?
   - Both with override behavior?
   - **Recommendation**: Offer both during init, default to project-level for teams

4. **How detailed should references/ be?**
   - Balance between completeness and token usage
   - Progressive disclosure strategy
   - Target: <500 lines total across all reference files

5. **Should we create tool-specific variants?**
   - One skill for all agents?
   - Or optimize for each (Claude, Cursor, Codex)?
   - **Answer**: Start with universal skill, create variants if needed

6. **Onboarding: How aggressive should skill installation be?**
   - Default to "Yes" for skill installation?
   - Show "Skip for now" option prominently?
   - **Recommendation**: Default to Yes but make skipping easy

7. **Multiple skills locations: Copy or symlink?**
   - If user wants skill in `.github/skills/` AND `.claude/skills/`, should we:
     - Copy to both locations (simple, works everywhere)
     - Create one canonical location + symlinks (single source of truth)
   - **Decision for v1**: Copy to all selected locations

8. **Should we detect AI tools first, then suggest matching skills folders?**
   - Example: Detected GitHub Copilot → suggest `.github/skills/`
   - Example: Detected Claude → suggest `.claude/skills/`
   - **Answer**: Yes, align suggestions with detected tools (leverage spec 126 logic)

9. **What if user has both project and user-level skills folders?**
   - Install to both automatically?
   - Ask which one to prioritize?
   - **Recommendation**: Show both options, let user choose (multi-select)

10. **Should we create a `lean-spec install-skill` command for post-init installation?**
    - Allows adding skill to existing projects
    - Useful for users who skipped during init
    - **Answer**: Yes, add this command in Phase 5

## Notes

### Why Agent Skills Matter

Agent Skills solve a **discoverability and portability problem**:

**Current state**:
- Users must manually configure tools (MCP server)
- Must learn methodology separately (AGENTS.md)
- Agent-specific setup (Claude vs Cursor vs Codex)
- Methodology locked in project docs

**With Agent Skills**:
- Drop SKILL.md in project → all compatible agents understand SDD
- Portable across tools (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Letta, Factory, etc.)
- Version-controlled methodology that travels with code
- Easy to share: just commit the skill folder

### Positioning

Agent Skills are an **addon feature**, not core infrastructure:
- **Core**: MCP server + CLI for spec operations
- **Addon**: Agent Skill teaches methodology to compatible agents
- **Benefit**: Users without skills can still use MCP/CLI directly

### Relationship to Spec 168

**Spec 168**: Desktop app as orchestration frontend  
**This spec**: Agent Skill teaching SDD methodology

**Synergy**:
- Skill teaches agents the methodology
- Desktop app provides GUI for visualization/management
- MCP connects them
- User gets complete solution

### Philosophical Alignment

This spec aligns with **LeanSpec First Principles** (spec 049):
1. **Context Economy**: Built into skill instructions (<2000 tokens)
2. **Signal-to-Noise**: Clear workflow guidance, no fluff
3. **Intent Over Implementation**: Skill teaches WHY, not just HOW
4. **Bridge the Gap**: Skills = human+AI shared understanding
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: SKILL.md + references/ structure

---

**Key Insight**: Agent Skills provide a **standard way** to share methodology across the AI coding ecosystem. This increases LeanSpec's reach beyond tools with MCP support.
