# PR Migration Verification: docs-site → lean-spec-docs

> **Status**: ✅ Complete · **Priority**: High · **Created**: 2025-11-17 · **Tags**: migration, docs, verification

**Project**: lean-spec  
**Team**: Core Development

## Overview

Successfully migrated PRs #66-69 from the old `lean-spec` repository to the new `lean-spec-docs` repository using cherry-pick approach (Option 1). These PRs contained substantial documentation improvements that were created before the docs-site migration to a separate repository.

**Problem**: After migrating docs-site to lean-spec-docs repo, discovered 4 unmerged PRs (#66-69) with ~4,500+ lines of documentation improvements that needed to be migrated.

**Solution**: Used git cherry-pick approach to extract and apply docs-site changes from each PR to the new repository, preserving all work without losing any content.

### PR #69: Chinese Localization (149 lines)
**Spec**: 091-chinese-localization-strategy  
**Status**: Complete (docs-site portion)  
**Commit**: 3b059ef

**Changes**:
- Created `i18n/zh-Hans/TERMINOLOGY_GLOSSARY.md` with standardized Chinese translations
- Comprehensive glossary for consistent terminology across all translations
- Includes core concepts, first principles, status/priority terms, CLI commands, etc.

**Note**: Web app i18n infrastructure (packages/web locales, hooks, components) from PR #69 applies to main lean-spec repo, not docs-site, so only the terminology glossary was migrated.

**Files modified**: 1 file
- New: `i18n/zh-Hans/TERMINOLOGY_GLOSSARY.md`

### Post-Migration QA Fix (ee70869, 2025-11-17)

After verification we found zh-Hans anchor references missing for the new terminology links. Commit `ee70869` adds:
- Explicit anchor IDs on `guide/first-principles` translation so cross-links resolve
- Translated `lean-spec tokens` reference section to surface `/reference/cli#lean-spec-tokens`
- FAQ link update to reuse the new anchor slug
- `pnpm build` now passes without broken-anchor warnings for en + zh-Hans

This commit is part of the same `migrate-prs-66-69` branch and must be included in the docs-site PR.

## Design

### Migration Approach

**Method**: Git cherry-pick with manual file extraction

**Process**:
1. Added old lean-spec repo as remote in docs-site submodule
2. Fetched PR branches from old repo
3. For each PR:
   - Extracted files from specific commits using `git show <commit>:<path>`
   - Applied changes manually to avoid path conflicts
   - Updated references (sidebar positions, links)
   - Tested build after each PR
   - Committed with descriptive message and PR reference
4. Pushed all commits to new branch in lean-spec-docs repo

**Why manual extraction vs direct cherry-pick?**
- Path differences: PR commits had `docs-site/` prefix, new repo doesn't
- Merge conflicts: PRs were based on different base branches
- Selective migration: Some PRs had non-docs changes (specs/, packages/)
- Build verification: Could test incrementally

```

### 5. Close Old PRs in lean-spec Repo

For each PR #66, #67, #68, #69, add comment:
```
This PR has been successfully migrated to the new docs repository at:
https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec-docs/pull/[new-pr-number]

All documentation changes from this PR are now tracked in lean-spec-docs.

Closing as the docs-site has been migrated to its own repository.
```

Then close each PR.

## Notes

### Migration Success Factors
- **Incremental approach**: Migrated one PR at a time with testing
- **Build verification**: Tested after each PR to catch issues early
- **Descriptive commits**: Each commit explains what was migrated and references source PR
- **Manual extraction**: Avoided complex merge conflicts by extracting files manually
- **Preserved content**: Zero content loss, all 4,500+ lines migrated successfully

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Path differences**: PRs had `docs-site/` prefix, required manual path adjustment
2. **Base branch differences**: PRs based on different branches, some included/excluded prior changes
3. **Web app vs docs-site**: PR #69 had both web app and docs-site changes, needed separation

### Technical Details
- **Remote added**: `git remote add old-repo https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec.git`
- **PR fetch pattern**: `git fetch old-repo pull/{N}/head:pr-{N}`
- **File extraction**: `git show <commit>:<path> > <target>`
- **Build tool**: Docusaurus with i18n support
- **Languages**: English (en), Chinese (zh-Hans)
