# Replace Manual DAG with Visualization Library

> **Status**: ✅ Complete · **Priority**: High · **Created**: 2025-11-17 · **Tags**: web, ux, dependencies, technical-debt

**Project**: lean-spec  
**Team**: Core Development

## Overview

**Problem**: The current spec dependencies DAG visualization has multiple issues:

1. **Implementation Issues** (Original Scope):
   - Font sizes too small (hard to read)
   - Edges not rendering (missing ReactFlow Handle components)
   - Manual SVG coordinate calculations causing overlap
   - Not responsive across viewport sizes
   - Hard to maintain (manual bezier curves, CSS calc())

2. **Data Completeness Issues** (Extended Scope):
   - Only shows outgoing `related` connections from current spec
   - Missing upstream dependencies (`dependsOn` relationships)
   - Missing downstream dependents (specs that depend on THIS spec)
   - Not showing bidirectional nature of `related` relationships
   - Incomplete graph prevents understanding full dependency chain

**Why Now**: During troubleshooting for spec #066 and testing spec #082, we discovered:
- DAG nodes overlapping due to coordinate system mismatches
- Font sizes too small to read
- Edges not rendering (ReactFlow Handle components missing)
- Can't see full dependency context (only current spec's perspective)

**Impact**: 
- Better readability (larger fonts, proper edge rendering)
- Complete dependency visualization (upstream, downstream, bidirectional)
- Easier maintenance with proper library
- More robust across viewport sizes

## Current Implementation Issues

**Code Location**: `/packages/web/src/components/spec-relationships.tsx`

**Problems Found**:
1. Mixed coordinate systems (SVG viewBox vs CSS %)
2. Manual bezier curve calculations for edges
3. Fixed column layout (COLUMN_X constants) doesn't adapt
4. `preserveAspectRatio="none"` causes distortion
5. Node positioning uses `calc(${xPercent}% - ${NODE_WIDTH / 2}px)` which breaks with aspect ratio changes

**Current Approach**:
- 3-column layout: Precedence (left) → Current (center) → Related (right)
- Nodes positioned with CSS absolute + calc()
- SVG paths drawn manually with fixed control points
- Container height calculated from node count

## Design

### Recommended Library: Reactflow

**Why Reactflow**:
- ✅ **React-native**: Built for React, excellent TypeScript support
- ✅ **Declarative**: Define nodes/edges, library handles layout
- ✅ **Auto-layout**: Built-in dagre/elk layout algorithms
- ✅ **Responsive**: Handles viewport changes automatically
- ✅ **Interactive**: Pan, zoom, node dragging out of the box
- ✅ **Customizable**: Custom node styles, edge types
- ✅ **Well-maintained**: 20K+ GitHub stars, active development
- ✅ **Small bundle**: ~50KB gzipped (reasonable for feature richness)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **D3.js**: Too low-level, requires manual layout management
- **Cytoscape.js**: Powerful but heavier, steeper learning curve
- **vis.js**: Unmaintained, no React integration
- **mermaid.js**: Static rendering, not interactive

### Implementation Approach

**Display Pattern**: Modal/Dialog (REQUIRED)
- Dependencies graph opens in a dialog/modal, not inline expansion
- Timeline also moves to modal (consistent pattern for spec metadata)
- Triggered by "Show Dependencies" and "Show Timeline" buttons
- Allows full screen space for complex graphs
- Better mobile experience (full screen modal vs cramped accordion)

**Replace Current Components**:
```tsx
// Current: Accordion expansion
<Accordion>
  <SpecRelationships relationships={...} />
</Accordion>

// New: Dialog with Reactflow
<Dialog>
  <SpecDependencyGraph relationships={...} />
</Dialog>
```

**Node Types**:
- **Current Spec**: Center node (non-interactive, highlighted, primary border)
- **Depends On (Upstream)**: Left side (amber styling, solid edges with arrows pointing right)
- **Required By (Downstream)**: Right side, top (red/orange styling, solid edges with arrows pointing left)
- **Related (Bidirectional)**: Right side, bottom (blue styling, dashed edges, bidirectional arrows)

**Complete Dependency Graph**:
To show the full picture, we need:
1. **Current spec's `dependsOn`** → shows as upstream nodes (left)
2. **Specs that depend on current spec** → shows as downstream nodes (right, top)
3. **Current spec's `related`** → shows as related nodes (right, bottom)
4. **Related specs that list current spec** → shows as related nodes (right, bottom)

**Data Requirements**:
Current API only provides current spec's perspective. Need to either:
- **Option A**: Fetch all related specs individually to check their relationships (client-side)
- **Option B**: Add API endpoint that returns complete graph (server-side, better performance)
- **Option C**: Implement in phases (current perspective first, then expand)

**Implementation Strategy**: Start with Option C (phased approach)
- **Phase 1** (MVP): Current spec perspective only (dependsOn + related) ✅
- **Phase 2**: Add API endpoint for complete graph (includes requiredBy + bidirectional related)
- **Phase 3**: Polish UX (better labels, tooltips, legend)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Use Reactflow's `dagre` layout algorithm
- Constrain to 3-column structure (precedence | current | related)
- Vertical spacing based on node count
- Automatically handle edge routing
- Dialog provides ample space for complex graphs

**Styling**:
- Match current design (rounded boxes, color scheme)
- Maintain distinction between precedence (amber) and related (blue)
- Full screen or large modal (80-90% viewport)
- Responsive: full screen on mobile, modal on desktop

- `/packages/web/src/types/specs.ts`

**Next Steps**: Phases 4-5 are optional UX polish and testing enhancements.

### Why Complete Dependency Graph Matters

**Current Limitation**: Only shows relationships FROM the current spec's perspective:
- Shows specs this one depends on (`dependsOn`)
- Shows specs this one is related to (`related`)
- **Missing**: Specs that depend on THIS spec (downstream impact)
- **Missing**: Specs that list THIS spec in their `related` (bidirectional)

**Example Problem**: 
- Spec A depends on Spec B
- When viewing Spec B, you can't see that Spec A is blocked by it
- Can't assess impact of changes to Spec B
- Can't see full dependency chain

**Solution**: API endpoint that returns complete graph:
```typescript
interface CompleteDependencyGraph {
  current: SpecMetadata;
  dependsOn: SpecMetadata[];      // Upstream (current depends on these)
  requiredBy: SpecMetadata[];     // Downstream (these depend on current)
  related: SpecMetadata[];        // Outgoing related links
  relatedBy: SpecMetadata[];      // Incoming related links
}
```

**Visualization Strategy**:
- **Left side**: Upstream dependencies (what this spec needs)
- **Center**: Current spec
- **Right side top**: Downstream dependents (what needs this spec)
- **Right side bottom**: Related specs (bidirectional connections)

### API Design Considerations

**Option A: In-Memory Graph (Recommended)**

Build complete dependency graph in-memory on server startup:

```typescript
class SpecDependencyGraph {
  private graph: Map<string, {
    dependsOn: Set<string>;
    requiredBy: Set<string>;
    related: Set<string>;
  }>;

  constructor(allSpecs: Spec[]) {
    this.buildGraph(allSpecs);
  }

  private buildGraph(specs: Spec[]) {
    // Initialize all nodes
    for (const spec of specs) {
      this.graph.set(spec.name, {
        dependsOn: new Set(spec.dependsOn || []),
        requiredBy: new Set(),
        related: new Set(spec.related || []),
      });
    }

    // Build reverse edges
    for (const [specName, node] of this.graph.entries()) {
      // For each dependsOn, add reverse requiredBy
      for (const dep of node.dependsOn) {
        this.graph.get(dep)?.requiredBy.add(specName);
      }
      // For each related, add bidirectional link
      for (const rel of node.related) {
        this.graph.get(rel)?.related.add(specName);
      }
    }
  }

  getCompleteGraph(specName: string): CompleteDependencyGraph {
    const node = this.graph.get(specName);
    if (!node) throw new Error(`Spec not found: ${specName}`);
    
    return {
      current: this.getSpecMetadata(specName),
      dependsOn: Array.from(node.dependsOn).map(n => this.getSpecMetadata(n)),
      requiredBy: Array.from(node.requiredBy).map(n => this.getSpecMetadata(n)),
      related: Array.from(node.related).map(n => this.getSpecMetadata(n)),
    };
  }
}
```

**Performance Analysis**:
- **Memory**: ~100 specs × (3 Sets × ~5 entries × 50 bytes) ≈ 75KB total
- **Startup**: O(n²) worst case, but typically O(n×d) where d = avg dependencies (~5)
  - 100 specs × 5 deps = 500 operations ≈ <1ms
- **Query**: O(1) graph lookup + O(d) metadata fetch ≈ <1ms
- **Conclusion**: Negligible memory/CPU impact, excellent query performance

**Option B: On-Demand Query** (Not Recommended)
- Query all specs on each request to find reverse dependencies
- O(n) per request where n = total specs
- Slower (10-50ms per request)
- No memory benefit (specs already loaded)

**Decision**: Use Option A (in-memory graph) - trivial memory cost for dramatic performance gain.

### CLI/MCP Impact Analysis

**Current CLI Commands Affected**:
- `lean-spec deps <spec>` - Shows dependencies from spec's perspective
- Need to enhance to show complete graph (requiredBy + bidirectional related)

**Proposed New Commands**:
- `lean-spec deps <spec> --complete` - Show full dependency graph
- `lean-spec deps <spec> --upstream` - Only show dependsOn
- `lean-spec deps <spec> --downstream` - Only show requiredBy
- `lean-spec deps <spec> --impact` - Show all specs affected by changes to this spec

**MCP Tools Affected**:
- `mcp_lean-spec_deps` - Currently shows dependencies, needs enhancement
- May need new tool: `mcp_lean-spec_dependency-graph` for complete view

**Related Spec Needed**: Yes
- **Spec #099**: "Enhanced Dependency Commands for CLI/MCP"
  - Implement in-memory graph in `@leanspec/core`
  - Add CLI commands for complete dependency views
  - Update MCP tools to support full graph
  - Ensure consistency between web, CLI, and MCP

**Core Package Changes**:
- Add `SpecDependencyGraph` class to `@leanspec/core`
- Export graph building utilities
- Share implementation between web API and CLI

### Timeline and Dependencies in Modals (REQUIRED)

**User Requirement**: Both timeline and dependencies MUST use modal/dialog pattern, not inline accordions.

**Rationale**:
- **More space**: Complex graphs and timelines need room to breathe
- **Better mobile UX**: Full screen modal vs cramped inline expansion
- **Consistent pattern**: All spec metadata (dependencies, timeline, transitions) in dialogs
- **Focus**: Modal isolates the view, easier to explore relationships
- **Performance**: Lazy load graph only when user opens dialog

**Implementation**:
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog component (already in project)
- "Show Dependencies" button → opens dependency graph modal
- "Show Timeline" button → opens timeline modal
- Mobile: Full screen modals
- Desktop: Large modals (80-90% viewport)
- Reactflow provides zoom/pan inside modal automatically

**Not Optional**: This is a core UX requirement, not a future enhancement. The modal pattern is part of the initial implementation.

### Related Issues

**Why These Specs Are Related**:

**Spec #066** (Context Economy Thresholds Refinement):
- **How it led here**: While testing token counting on spec #066, we opened the dependency graph
- **Issues discovered**: Nodes were overlapping, fonts too small, edges not rendering
- **Trigger**: This visualization problem became apparent during spec #066 testing
- **Connection**: Good dependency visualization helps assess spec complexity/relationships

**Spec #082** (Web App Realtime Spec Sync Architecture):
- **How it relates**: Defines the data layer (FilesystemSource, DatabaseSource, SpecsService)
- **Dependency**: This spec relies on the service layer architecture from #082
- **API changes**: Complete dependency graph endpoint will use #082's service pattern
- **Testing context**: Spec #082 has 5 related connections, perfect for testing DAG improvements
- **Coordination**: Any API changes should follow #082's architectural patterns

**Spec #099** (To Be Created - Enhanced Dependency Commands):
- **Scope**: CLI/MCP enhancements for complete dependency graph
- **Shared code**: In-memory graph implementation in `@leanspec/core`
- **Consistency**: Ensure web, CLI, MCP all show same dependency information
- **Dependencies**: This spec (#097) should complete Phase 2 before #099 starts
