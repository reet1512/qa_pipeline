# LeanSpec Web: UX/UI Enhancements Phase 2

> **Status**: ✅ Complete · **Priority**: High · **Created**: 2025-11-12 · **Tags**: web, ux, enhancement, v0.3.0-launch

**Project**: lean-spec  
**Team**: Core Development  
**Related**: Spec 035 (live-specs-showcase)

## Overview

This spec captures the remaining UX/UI enhancements and missing features for the LeanSpec Web platform that were identified during Phase 1 development (spec 035) but deferred as out-of-scope for the MVP. These enhancements will significantly improve the user experience and complete the professional polish of the application.

**Dependency**: This spec **depends on** spec 035 Phase 1 MVP completion (~80% done). Work cannot start until foundational UI/UX is stable.

**Why now?**
- Phase 1 MVP (spec 035) is nearly complete with critical fixes applied
- Users need these features for a complete, professional experience
- Several items are blockers for broader adoption (quick search, proper navigation)
- Must be completed before official v0.3.0 launch
- Can run in parallel with spec 035 Phase 2 (GitHub integration)

**What's included?**
- Stats page completion
- Spec detail page redesign (sidebar, sticky elements, better metadata display)
- Sub-spec navigation improvements
- Quick search functionality (Cmd+K)
- Loading states and skeletons
- Enhanced empty states
- Toast notifications
- Logo and favicon
- Accessibility improvements

## Design

See **[DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)** for comprehensive UI/UX design system specifications, component patterns, and implementation details.

### 1. Stats Page Completion

**Current State**: Basic stats cards exist but many sections are incomplete or missing.

**Required Enhancements:**
- Full statistics dashboard with all metrics from API
- Trend charts/sparklines showing progress over time
- Filtering by date range, status, priority
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- Responsive grid layout with proper empty states
- Interactive tooltips on hover

**Technical Approach:**
- Use recharts or similar charting library for visualizations
- Implement date range picker component
- Add CSV/PDF export utilities
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

### 2. Spec Detail Page Redesign

**Current Issues:**
- No sidebar for quick navigation between specs
- Metadata area is not sticky
- Header doesn't stick on scroll
- Frontmatter display is poorly formatted

**Required Changes:**

**a) Sidebar Navigation**
- Left sidebar (collapsible) showing list of all specs
- Quick navigation to any spec without going back to list
- Search/filter within sidebar
- Current spec highlighted
- Sticky positioning

**b) Sticky Left Info Panel**
- Metadata area (timeline, status, priority, tags) should stick on scroll
- Keep important info visible as user reads long spec
- Right side content scrolls normally

**c) Sticky Header**
- Spec title and key actions stay visible on scroll
- Breadcrumb navigation sticky
- Theme toggle always accessible

**d) Improved Frontmatter Display**
- Better visual hierarchy for metadata
- Icons for each field (already implemented for some)
- Cleaner layout using cards/sections
- Better spacing and typography

### 3. Sub-Spec Navigation Improvements

**Current Issues:**
- Tab design doesn't clearly indicate sub-spec structure
- No clear visual hierarchy
- Confusing to understand relationship between main spec and sub-specs

**Required Changes:**
- Redesign tab navigation to show clear hierarchy
- Add visual indicators for sub-spec types (icons, colors)
- Show overview tab that lists all sub-specs with descriptions
- Breadcrumb showing current sub-spec location
- Side navigation option as alternative to tabs
- Better mobile experience for sub-spec switching

### 4. Quick Search Modal (Cmd+K)

**Feature**: Global keyboard-triggered search

**Requirements:**
- Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+K` (Mac) / `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux)
- Fuzzy search across all specs (title, content, tags)
- Recent searches stored locally
- Navigate results with arrow keys
- Preview snippet in results
- Filter by status, priority, tags
- Responsive design

**Technical Approach:**
- Use Radix UI Dialog component
- Implement fuzzy search with fuse.js or similar
- Store recent searches in localStorage
- Debounce search input for performance
- Server-side search endpoint for full-text search

### 5. Loading States & Skeletons

**Current State**: No loading indicators for async content

**Required:**
- Skeleton loaders for all pages during data fetch
- Suspense boundaries at route level
- Loading spinners for actions (create, update, delete)
- Skeleton components for:
  - Spec list/table
  - Spec detail page
  - Stats cards
  - Kanban board
- Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states

**Technical Approach:**
- Create reusable skeleton components
- Use React Suspense with Server Components
- Add loading.tsx files for Next.js route segments
- Implement progressive loading for large lists

### 6. Enhanced Empty States

**Current State**: Basic empty messages

**Required:**
- More helpful messaging with context
- Actionable next steps (CTAs)
- Icons/illustrations for visual interest
- Different empty states for:
  - No specs yet (with "Create first spec" CTA)
  - No results found (with "Clear filters" CTA)
  - No archived specs (with helpful message)
  - Empty kanban columns (with status explanation)
- Consistent design across all empty states

### 7. Toast Notifications

**Feature**: User feedback system for actions

**Requirements:**
- Toast notifications for:
  - Successful actions (create, update, delete)
  - Error messages
  - Warning messages
  - Info messages
- Auto-dismiss after configurable timeout
- Manual dismiss option
- Stack multiple toasts
- Position: top-right or bottom-right
- Accessible (screen reader support)

**Technical Approach:**
- Use sonner or react-hot-toast library
- Consistent styling with design system
- Different variants (success, error, warning, info)
- Action buttons within toasts when needed

### 8. Logo & Favicon

**Current State**: No logo or favicon

**Required:**
- Logo design for LeanSpec brand
- Multiple sizes for different uses:
  - Header logo (with and without text)
  - Favicon (16x16, 32x32, 192x192, 512x512)
  - Apple touch icon
  - Social media preview image (og:image)
- SVG format for scalability
- Dark/light mode variants if needed

**Technical Approach:**
- Work with designer or use AI tools to generate logo
- Export in all required formats
- Add to Next.js public directory
- Update metadata in layout.tsx
- Test across browsers and devices

### 9. Accessibility Improvements

**Requirements:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators visible and clear
- Screen reader support (ARIA labels, roles)
- Skip links for main content
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast validation (all text meets AA standard)
- Form accessibility (labels, error messages)

**Technical Approach:**
- Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
- Use axe DevTools for testing
- Test with keyboard only
- Test with screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA)
- Fix all critical and high priority issues

## Notes

### Dependencies
- Related to spec 035 (live-specs-showcase)
- Requires completion of Phase 1 MVP
- Some features may require design input/review

### Design Decisions

**Why Cmd+K for search?**
- Industry standard (GitHub, Linear, Notion, etc.)
- Discoverable and easy to remember
- Doesn't conflict with browser shortcuts

**Why toast notifications?**
- Non-intrusive
- Auto-dismiss reduces clutter
- Standard pattern users expect
- Better than modal dialogs for simple feedback

**Why skeleton loaders?**
- Research shows skeletons reduce perceived wait time
- Better UX than spinners alone
- Makes loading feel faster
- Indicates layout structure

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should logo be designed in-house or contracted?
- [ ] Do we need a design review for sub-spec navigation redesign?
- [ ] Should stats page support custom date ranges or predefined only?
- [ ] What's the budget for professional logo design?

### Future Enhancements (Post Phase 2)
- Collaborative features (comments, annotations)
- Version history visualization
- Advanced search with filters
- Saved search queries
- Keyboard shortcuts panel (showing all shortcuts)
- Dark mode improvements (better colors, more contrast options)
