# UI Realtime File Watch & Sync

## Overview

Currently, the UI requires manual refresh to see spec changes, or relies on cache TTL (60s default from spec 082). This creates a poor developer experience when actively working on specs.

**Problem Statement:**
- Spec changes in `specs/` directory don't appear in UI immediately
- Cache TTL (60s) means up to 1-minute delay
- Manual refresh required for immediate updates
- No live feedback when editing specs

**Goal:**
Implement true realtime sync that pushes spec changes from backend to frontend automatically, eliminating manual refresh.

**User Experience:**
1. User edits a spec file in their editor
2. File watcher detects change within <1s
3. Backend invalidates cache and pushes update via WebSocket/SSE
4. Frontend automatically refreshes affected views
5. User sees changes appear instantly without refresh

## Design

The architecture uses a three-tier approach with file watching, push communication, and reactive UI updates.

### Architecture Overview

```

### Technology Options

**Backend File Watching:**
- Rust: `notify` crate (cross-platform, efficient)
- Node.js: `chokidar` (if using Node backend)

**Push Communication:**
1. **WebSocket** (bidirectional)
   - Pros: Full duplex, can send client actions
   - Cons: More complex state management
   - Use case: Interactive features (live editing)

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** (recommended)
   - Pros: Simpler, HTTP/2, auto-reconnect
   - Cons: One-way (server → client only)
   - Use case: Read-only updates (perfect for spec viewing)

**Frontend Integration:**
- React hooks for WebSocket/SSE connection
- React Query or SWR for cache invalidation
- Toast notifications for change awareness

### Implementation Details

See `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed code examples, API specifications, and configuration options.

Key implementation points:
- Use Rust `notify` crate for cross-platform file watching
- Broadcast channel for distributing events to SSE clients
- React Query integration for automatic cache invalidation
- Exponential backoff for connection retries

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

Handling edge cases and errors gracefully is critical for production reliability.

### File Watcher Edge Cases
- Debounce rapid changes (e.g., VSCode auto-save)
- Ignore temp files (.swp, ~, .tmp)
- Handle file lock conflicts
- Graceful degradation if watcher fails

**SSE Connection:**
- Auto-reconnect on connection loss
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Fallback to polling if SSE unavailable
- Handle browser tab visibility (pause when hidden)

**Performance:**
- Max 100 concurrent SSE connections
- Rate limit change events (max 10/sec)
- Only send changes for watched specs
- Compress large payloads

## Performance Impact

Understanding the performance implications helps with capacity planning.

### Backend Overhead
- File watcher: ~5-10MB memory overhead
- SSE connections: ~1KB per connection
- CPU: Negligible (<1% with 100 connections)

**Frontend:**
- SSE connection: ~2KB memory
- Network: ~1KB/min (keepalive pings)
- Minimal battery impact

**Comparison to Polling:**
- Polling (10s interval): 6 requests/min
- SSE: 1 connection, only data when changed
- **Result: 90% reduction in unnecessary requests**

## Test

Test plan covers functional, performance, and deployment scenarios.

### Functional Tests

**File Watching:**
- [ ] Detects spec file creation
- [ ] Detects spec file modification
- [ ] Detects spec file deletion
- [ ] Detects spec rename
- [ ] Ignores temp files (.swp, ~)
- [ ] Debounces rapid changes correctly
- [ ] Works with subdirectories

**SSE Connection:**
- [ ] Client connects successfully
- [ ] Receives change events
- [ ] Auto-reconnects on disconnect
- [ ] Keep-alive prevents timeout
- [ ] Multiple clients receive same events
- [ ] Graceful shutdown on server stop

**Frontend Integration:**
- [ ] Spec list auto-refreshes on change
- [ ] Spec detail page auto-refreshes
- [ ] Dependencies view updates
- [ ] Board view updates
- [ ] Toast notifications appear
- [ ] No duplicate invalidations

- [ ] Handles rapid changes (10+ per second)
- [ ] Handles file lock conflicts
- [ ] Handles network interruption
- [ ] Handles tab visibility changes
- [ ] Handles browser sleep/wake

### Performance Tests

**Backend:**
- [ ] Memory usage <50MB with 100 connections
- [ ] CPU usage <5% under normal load
- [ ] Event latency <100ms from file change
- [ ] No memory leaks over 24 hours

**Frontend:**

- [ ] Reconnection completes <3s
- [ ] No UI jank during updates
- [ ] Battery impact negligible

**Comparison:**
- [ ] SSE uses 90% less bandwidth than polling
- [ ] Updates appear 10x faster than cache TTL
- [ ] Better UX than manual refresh

### Deployment Tests

**Self-Hosted:**
- [ ] Works with local specs/ directory
- [ ] File watcher permissions correct
- [ ] SSE works behind reverse proxy

**Vercel (Serverless):**
- [ ] ⚠️ File watching may not work in serverless
- [ ] Fallback to cache TTL documented
- [ ] Alternative: webhook-based sync

## Notes

Additional context, considerations, and future plans for this feature.

### Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- Spec 082 (Web App Realtime Sync Architecture) - base caching layer
- Spec 186 (Rust HTTP Server) - backend implementation
- Spec 184 (Unified UI Architecture) - frontend integration

**Enables:**
- Better developer experience for spec editing
- Live collaboration possibilities (future)
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Reduced server load (vs polling)

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Polling (Current)**
   - Simple but inefficient
   - High latency (10-60s)
   - Unnecessary requests when no changes

2. **WebSocket (Full Duplex)**
   - Overkill for read-only updates
   - More complex state management
   - Better for future live editing features

3. **SSE (Recommended)**
   - ✅ Perfect for one-way updates
   - ✅ Simple, built-in reconnection
   - ✅ Works with HTTP/2 multiplexing
   - ✅ Standard EventSource API

4. **Long Polling**
   - Legacy approach
   - Higher latency than SSE
   - Not recommended

### Deployment Considerations

**Vercel (Serverless):**
- ⚠️ **Limitation**: File system is read-only in serverless functions
- ⚠️ **File watching may not work** due to ephemeral nature
- **Workaround**: Use webhook-based approach (spec 082 Phase 3)
- **Alternative**: Deploy to long-running server (Fly.io, Railway)

**Self-Hosted (Recommended):**
- ✅ Full file system access
- ✅ File watching works perfectly
- ✅ Better for development environments
- Use case: Desktop app, local UI server

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Detect environment at runtime
- Enable file watching for self-hosted
- Fall back to cache TTL for serverless
- Document trade-offs clearly

### Security Considerations

**Rate Limiting:**
- Max 100 SSE connections per IP
- Max 10 events per second per connection
- Prevent DoS attacks

**Authentication:**
- SSE endpoint should require auth token
- Validate token on connection
- Support JWT or session-based auth

**Data Exposure:**
- Only send public spec data
- Don't include sensitive metadata
- Filter events based on user permissions

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 2:**
- Live editing with conflict resolution
- Multi-user presence indicators
- Real-time collaboration features

**Phase 3:**
- Incremental spec parsing (only changed sections)
- Binary diff for large specs
- WebSocket upgrade for bidirectional features

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should SSE be enabled by default or opt-in?
- [ ] What's the right debounce timeout? (300ms proposed)
- [ ] How to handle Vercel serverless limitations?
- [ ] Should we support both SSE and WebSocket?
- [ ] What happens with 1000+ concurrent users?

### Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- Latency: File change → UI update <1s (99th percentile)
- Bandwidth: 90% reduction vs polling
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime for SSE connections
- Performance: <5% CPU overhead

**Qualitative:**
- No manual refresh needed
- Instant feedback when editing specs
- Seamless multi-tab experience
- Better developer experience
