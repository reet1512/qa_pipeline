# Marketing & Launch Strategy

Positioning, messaging, channels, and content strategy for v0.2.0 launch.

## Brand Identity

**Logo:** Version 3 of Concept D (Bracket Style)
- Minimalist bracket frame with "LS" monogram
- Represents: Context window/boundary (specs must fit), code-like aesthetic
- Works at all sizes (16px to full-size)
- Color variants: Dark (#1a1a2e), Light (white), Accent (#00d9ff)
- SVG format for scalability

**Design Rationale:**
- Brackets visually represent "bounded context" (Context Economy principle)
- Minimal, technical aesthetic matches first-principles philosophy
- LS monogram is simple and memorable
- Scales perfectly from favicons to headers

**Brand Assets Needed:**
- [ ] Export logo as SVG, PNG (16px, 32px, 64px, 128px, 512px)
- [ ] Create favicon (16x16, 32x32)
- [ ] Update docs site with logo in header
- [ ] Add logo to README.md
- [ ] Create social media assets (Twitter card, OG image)
- [ ] GitHub social preview image (1280x640)

## Marketing Positioning

**Tagline:** "First-Principles Spec-Driven Development for AI-powered teams"

### Key Messages
1. **First Principles Foundation** - Built on 5 immutable constraints (physics, biology, economics)
2. **Operationalized Philosophy** - Tools that enforce principles, not just document them
3. **AI-native** - Built for human + AI collaboration from the ground up
4. **Practice what we preach** - Dogfooded extensively, specs demonstrate principles

### Differentiation
- **vs Traditional SDD**: We optimize for context windows and token costs (first principles, not convention)
- **vs Agile**: We capture intent for AI execution (Bridge the Gap principle)
- **vs "No docs"**: We document what matters (Signal-to-Noise principle)
- **vs Heavyweight tools**: We stay lean by design (Context Economy principle)

### Target Audience (Priority Order)
1. Solo developers using Cursor/Copilot/Claude (need lightweight SDD)
2. Small teams (2-5 devs) adopting AI pair programming
3. Startups scaling from solo to team (Progressive Disclosure)
4. Engineering teams frustrated with heavyweight SDD
5. First-principles thinkers curious about principled design

## Marketing Content Checklist

### Pre-Launch
- [x] **Branding & Assets** - ✅ COMPLETE (spec 052)
  - [x] Export logo in all required formats (SVG: 4 variants, PNG: 16/32/64/128/256/512)
  - [x] Create favicon files (16x16, 32x32, .ico)
  - [x] Update docs site with logo (theme-aware variants configured)
  - [x] Add logo to README.md (centered with badges)
  - [x] Create social media assets (social-card.png, social-github.png)
  - [x] Branding guidelines documented (BRANDING.md)
- [x] Write launch blog post - ✅ DRAFTED (blog/2025-11-10-ai-agent-performance.mdx, 275 lines)
- [x] Create demo scripts - ✅ COMPLETE (DEMO-AI-ASSISTED.md with full voiceover)
- [ ] **Record AI-assisted workflow video (split-screen, 3-5 min)** ← Next priority
- [ ] Create short GIF demos extracted from main video
- [ ] Prepare social media posts
- [ ] Write comparison guides (vs Agile, vs No Docs)
- [ ] Create Product Hunt submission
- [ ] Prepare Hacker News Show HN post

**Demo Strategy:** Focus on AI-native workflow (MCP integration, semantic memory, natural conversation) rather than CLI commands. Differentiate from traditional spec tools.

### Launch Day
- [ ] Publish blog post
- [ ] Submit to Product Hunt (Tuesday 00:01 PST)
- [ ] Post on Hacker News
- [ ] Tweet launch announcement thread
- [ ] Post on Reddit communities
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn
- [ ] Post in relevant Discord servers
- [ ] Monitor all channels for feedback

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Respond to comments/questions within 2 hours
- [ ] Collect testimonials from early users
- [ ] Write follow-up posts based on feedback
- [ ] Create case studies from dogfooding
- [ ] Plan content calendar for ongoing updates

## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"LeanSpec is spec-driven development for AI-powered teams. We enforce first principles like Context Economy and Signal-to-Noise through tooling, not just documentation. Specs stay under 400 lines, fit in context windows, and work seamlessly with AI coding agents."

### Problem Statement
"Traditional documentation is either too heavyweight (loses signal in noise) or nonexistent (AI can't understand intent). LeanSpec finds the middle ground: minimal, structured specs optimized for both human and AI consumption."

### Solution Overview
"Five first principles guide every decision: Context Economy, Signal-to-Noise, Intent Over Implementation, Bridge the Gap, and Progressive Disclosure. We operationalize these through validation, complexity analysis, and pattern detection."

### Call to Action
"Install in 30 seconds: `npm install -g lean-spec`. Create your first spec in 5 minutes. Let the tooling enforce good practices."

---

## Community Building

### GitHub Setup
- [ ] Set up GitHub Discussions (needs repo settings access)
- [ ] Create issue templates (bug, feature, question) in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- [x] Enhanced CONTRIBUTING.md - ✅ EXISTS (needs review for first principles guidance)
- [ ] Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for community management

### FAQ Content
**"Why <400 lines?"**
- Context windows (AI), working memory (humans), token costs (economics)

**"Isn't this too restrictive?"**
- Use sub-specs for complex features. Constraint breeds clarity.

**"How is this different from Agile/Lean?"**
- Optimized for AI execution, not just human communication

**"Can I use custom fields?"**
- Yes! Progressive Disclosure: add when you need them

### Support Strategy
- Respond to issues within 24 hours
- Weekly community highlights in Discussions
- Monthly office hours / AMA sessions
- Recognize contributors in CHANGELOG
