## First Principles Validation Checklist

Before v0.2.0 launch, verify all specs follow first principles:

### Context Economy (< 400 lines)
- [ ] All specs under 400 lines OR split into sub-specs
- [ ] No warnings from `lean-spec complexity` (when implemented)
- [ ] Each spec readable in <10 minutes

### Signal-to-Noise (Every word informs decisions)
- [ ] No "maybe future" content in specs
- [ ] Every section answers: "What decision does this inform?"
- [ ] Cut obvious or inferable content

### Intent Over Implementation (Capture why)
- [ ] All specs explain rationale for decisions
- [ ] Trade-offs documented
- [ ] Success criteria clear

### Bridge the Gap (Both human and AI understand)
- [ ] Clear structure + natural language
- [ ] AI agents can parse and reason about specs
- [ ] Humans understand overview quickly

### Progressive Disclosure (Add complexity when needed)
- [ ] Start simple, add structure when pain felt
- [ ] No "just in case" features
- [ ] Sub-specs used appropriately

## Performance Benchmarks

Target performance for common operations:

- [ ] `lean-spec list` < 100ms (for repos with <100 specs)
- [ ] `lean-spec search` < 500ms (full-text search)
- [ ] `lean-spec view` < 50ms (single spec)
- [ ] `lean-spec board` < 200ms (with stats)
- [ ] `lean-spec stats` < 300ms (full analytics)

Test with various repo sizes:
- Small: 10 specs
- Medium: 50 specs
- Large: 200+ specs
