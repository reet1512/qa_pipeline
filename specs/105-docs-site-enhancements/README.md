# Documentation Site Optimization and Enhancements

> **Status**: ✅ Complete · **Priority**: Medium · **Created**: 2025-11-18

**Project**: lean-spec  
**Team**: Core Development

## Overview

This spec addresses comprehensive improvements to the documentation site based on structural issues, content accuracy, translation gaps, and user experience concerns identified during review.

### Problems

**Content Structure Issues:**
- Navigation hierarchy is confusing for first-time users
- Content is scattered across multiple levels when it should be consolidated
- Tutorial content includes video walkthrough placeholders that don't align with AI-first approach

**Content Accuracy Issues:**
- Outdated references to line-count metrics instead of token-based
- Usage docs don't match current implementation
- Reference docs may be out of sync with codebase

**Translation & Localization Issues:**
- Examples section not translated to Chinese
- Missing translations in other sections
- Poor quality Chinese translations in landing page
- "Web App" needs better Chinese translation

**Missing Content:**
- `lean-spec ui` / `@leanspec/ui` package not documented (needs separate spec)

### Goals

1. **Improve Information Architecture**: Restructure docs to guide users from beginner → intermediate → advanced
2. **Update Content Accuracy**: Align all docs with current implementation (token-based, not line-based)
3. **Complete Translations**: Ensure feature parity between English and Chinese docs
4. **Enhance User Experience**: Simplify landing experience, remove placeholders, improve tutorial flow

## Design

### 1. Information Architecture Restructuring

**Introduction Section:**
- Simplify "Overview" - make it concise and intuitive for first-timers
- Consider merging with "Core Concepts -> What Is LeanSpec" for consistency
- Move "Migrating to LeanSpec" to top-level navigation (beside Roadmap)

**Core Concepts Reorganization:**
- Rename "Understanding Specs" → "Understanding LeanSpec" (broader scope)
- Remove "Terminology Overview" as separate page
- Restructure terminology directly after "Understanding LeanSpec":
  - **Keep as-is**: "Spec", "SDD Workflow"
  - **Merge**: "Sub-Specs" content into "Spec" concept
  - **Consolidate**: "Status", "Dependencies", "Tags & Priority" into "Built-in Fields" or "Metadata" concept
- Expand terminology content with in-depth explanations:
  - Why LeanSpec is designed this way
  - How concepts work behind the scenes
  - Help users transition from beginner → intermediate/advanced

**Usage Section Restructuring:**
- Remove "AI-Assisted Workflows -> Writing Specs AI Can Execute"
- Lift "AI-Assisted Workflows" docs up one level (after "Advanced Features")

**Examples Section:**
- Fix: Default doc should not be named "index" (use proper descriptive name)

### 2. Content Updates

**Switch from Line-Count to Token-Based:**
- Audit all docs for line-count references (especially "Advanced Topics")
- Replace with token-based metrics
- Ensure consistency with current implementation

**Update Outdated Content:**
- Review all "Usage" docs against current codebase
- Update "Reference" tab to match current CLI implementation
- Verify code examples and command outputs are current

**Tutorial Content:**
- Remove video walkthrough placeholders (timestamps like 00:30, 02:10)
- Rewrite tutorials emphasizing AI-assisted workflow:
  - Human developer expresses intent
  - AI helps with spec creation, drafting, and implementation
  - Focus on conversational, intent-driven development

### 3. Translation & Localization

**Complete Missing Translations:**
- Translate all "Examples" docs to Chinese
- Audit for other missing translations (systematic review)
- Ensure feature parity between English and Chinese versions

**Improve Translation Quality:**
- Landing page: Replace "轻量级规范方法论，助力 AI 驱动开发" with better tagline
  - Consider: Focus on clarity and natural Chinese phrasing
  - Avoid literal translation
- "Web App" → Find more natural Chinese equivalent
  - Consider: "网页应用" or context-specific term

### 4. Deferred Items

**Out of Scope for This Spec:**
- `lean-spec ui` / `@leanspec/ui` documentation (track in separate spec)

### Technical Approach

1. **Content Audit Phase:**
   - Script to find all line-count references
   - Manual review of outdated content in Usage/Reference sections
   - Translation gap analysis

2. **Restructuring Phase:**
   - Update sidebars.ts for navigation changes
   - Move/rename files as needed
   - Update cross-references and links

3. **Content Improvement Phase:**
   - Rewrite simplified content with depth
   - Update examples and commands
   - Improve tutorials

4. **Translation Phase:**
   - Translate missing content
   - Improve existing translations
   - Verify completeness

## Status Update · 2025-11-20

**Completed (All Phases)**
- ✅ **Introduction Simplification (Phase 2)**: Simplified `docs/guide/index.mdx` to be concise and intuitive. Merged "Principles" and "When to Write" from `what-is-leanspec.mdx` into `understanding-leanspec.mdx` (both English and Chinese) and deleted the redundant file.
- ✅ **Final Validation (Phase 5)**:
  - Fixed broken links in English and Chinese docs caused by file deletion.
  - Verified build success for both locales (`npm run build`).
  - Confirmed navigation flow and translation consistency.
- ✅ **Usage Doc Audit (Phase 3)**: Systematically verified all 13 usage docs against current CLI output. All docs are accurate and up-to-date.
- ✅ **Examples Translation (Phase 4)**: Verified `cross-team-official-launch.mdx` and `refactoring-monorepo-core.mdx` are fully translated to Chinese.
- ✅ **Chinese Localization Polish (Phase 4)**:
  - Updated landing page tagline to "专为 AI 协作设计的轻量级规范" (Lightweight spec designed for AI collaboration).
  - Updated "Web App" translation to "Web 应用" in navbar.
  - Translated "Examples" to "示例" in navbar.

## Status Update · 2025-11-19

**Completed (Phases 1-3)**
- ✅ Navigation restructure (`docs-site/sidebars.ts`) now surfaces Migration, Core Concepts, and AI-Assisted content in the intended beginner → advanced order.
- ✅ `docs-site/docs/guide/understanding-leanspec.mdx` (and the zh-Hans translation) fully replaces the old "Understanding Specs" doc with deeper rationale and working-memory guidance.
- ✅ Terminology was consolidated: sub-spec coverage folded into `guide/terminology/spec.mdx`, and the new `guide/terminology/built-in-metadata.mdx` (plus zh-Hans) replaces the individual status/dependency/tag pages.
- ✅ Examples landing doc renamed to `examples/overview.mdx` (and translated) so the sidebar no longer points at an `index` placeholder.
- ✅ Validation guidance (`docs-site/docs/guide/usage/project-management/validation.mdx`) now speaks in token thresholds rather than line counts, keeping the docs consistent with the CLI's token tooling.
- ✅ Token-first messaging now covers the FAQ, comparison page, MCP reference, and context-engineering guide (including zh-Hans translations) so there are no remaining "300-line"/"line limit" references in the docs-site.
- ✅ Chinese localization mirrors the new terminology so both languages describe the 2,000/3,500/5,000-token thresholds consistently.
- ✅ "Writing Specs AI Can Execute" page removed and replaced with `ai-executable-patterns.mdx` in the correct location.
- ✅ "AI-Assisted Workflows" lifted to correct hierarchy level (under usage/, not buried deeper).
- ✅ Tutorial cleanup complete: All video walkthrough placeholders and timestamps removed from `docs/tutorials/writing-first-spec-with-ai.mdx` (both English and Chinese versions).
- ✅ Broken links fixed: `/docs/guide/terminology` → `/docs/guide/terminology/spec`, `/docs/examples` → `/docs/examples/overview`.
- ✅ Build validation passed: `npm run build` succeeds with no broken links or errors.

**Priority Next Actions (Remaining from Phases 3-5)**

1. **Examples Translation** (Phase 4) - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Translate `docs/examples/cross-team-official-launch.mdx` to Chinese
   - Translate `docs/examples/refactoring-monorepo-core.mdx` to Chinese

2. **Introduction Simplification** (Phase 2)
   - Condense `docs/guide/index.mdx` (currently 150 lines) for better first-time user experience

3. **Usage Docs Validation** (Phase 3)
   - Systematically verify all usage docs against current CLI output (see Usage Doc Audit table)

4. **Chinese Localization Polish** (Phase 4)
   - Improve landing page Chinese tagline (current: "轻量级规范方法论，助力 AI 驱动开发")
   - Improve "Web App" Chinese translation (consider "网页应用" or context-specific term)

5. **Final Validation** (Phase 5)
   - Test navigation flow for beginner → advanced progression
   - Spot-check translation quality

### Design Decisions

**Why consolidate metadata concepts?**
Status, Dependencies, Tags, and Priority are all system-managed frontmatter fields. Grouping them helps users understand LeanSpec's metadata model holistically rather than as fragmented concepts.

**Why expand terminology content?**
Original feedback noted over-simplification. Users need to understand the "why" behind LeanSpec's design to appreciate its value and use it effectively. This bridges the gap from beginner to intermediate/advanced usage.

**Why lift AI-Assisted Workflows?**
These workflows are central to LeanSpec's value proposition and should be prominent in navigation, not buried under Usage section.

**Why focus tutorials on AI-assisted approach?**
LeanSpec is designed for AI-first development. Video walkthrough placeholders suggest manual, traditional workflows. Rewriting with AI-assisted focus aligns tutorials with core methodology.

### Open Questions

- **Chinese tagline alternatives**: Need to brainstorm better options than current "轻量级规范方法论，助力 AI 驱动开发"
  - Consider focus on outcomes vs methodology
  - Test with native speakers
  
- **Examples naming convention**: What should default doc be called instead of "index"?
  - "Overview"?
  - "Getting Started"?
  - Or directly use first real example?

### Related Work

- Separate spec needed for `@leanspec/ui` documentation
- May want to track translation process improvements if this reveals systematic issues
