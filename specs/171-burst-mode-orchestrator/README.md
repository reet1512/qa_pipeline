## Vision & Objectives

Build an intelligent code orchestrator based on **LeanSpec** to achieve an automated closed-loop "Spec-Driven Development" workflow.

The core concept is **"Ralph Mode"** (also called "Ralph technique" or "burst mode"): an autonomous AI development loop pattern originally created by [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). In its purest form, Ralph is a simple bash loop: `while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done`

This spec adapts the Ralph pattern to LeanSpec's ecosystem, trading computational resources (tokens) and time for exceptionally high code quality. The system takes over the "code-test-fix" PDCA cycle until the code passes all defined specifications or reaches maximum iterations, significantly reducing human intervention in code review and minor fixes.

**Core Values:**

* **Quality over Speed:** The process can be slow, but results must be accurate.
* **Spec as Truth:** Code is only complete when it satisfies all spec requirements AND passes formal tests.
* **Autonomous Iteration:** Automated error analysis and self-correction.

## Relationship to Other Specs

This spec defines a **coding pattern** that can be implemented within the orchestration infrastructure defined in:

* **123-ai-coding-agent-integration**: Provides the dispatch interface for triggering AI agents. Ralph mode integrates via `--ralph` or `--burst` flag on `agent run` command.
* **158-persistent-agent-sessions**: Enables multi-phase workflows (each Ralph iteration = one phase)
* **168-leanspec-orchestration-platform**: Desktop app UI for controlling Ralph sessions

Ralph Mode is **not** a standalone tool but a **pattern** for orchestrating agents, inspired by the [ralph-claude-code](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code) project:

```

## System Architecture

The system uses an **Agentic Loop** architecture. It's not just code generation, but a "generate + verify" combination.

### Core Components

1. **Planner:** Receives natural language requirements and converts them into structured Spec and Test Cases.
2. **Coder:** Generates/modifies implementation code based on the Spec.
3. **Executor (Sandbox):** A secure runtime (Node.js/Docker) that runs tests and captures `stdout/stderr`.
4. **Critic (Verification Engine):** Analyzes test results AND verifies spec completion. Performs comprehensive validation:
   - **Test Analysis:** Analyzes error logs and stack traces when tests fail
   - **Spec Verification:** Even when tests pass, validates all requirements are implemented
   - **Acceptance Criteria (AC) Check:** Ensures all ACs are met
   - **Completeness Audit:** Prevents false positives from self-claimed "passes"
   - **Gap Analysis:** Identifies missing functionality not covered by tests

       │                    • No missing functionality?

       │
       ├─> Incomplete → Gap Analysis → Refinement Prompt
       │
       └─> Complete & Verified → ✅ Done
```

## Workflow Logic (The Ralph Loop)

The orchestrator's core is a `while` loop with the following logic, adapted from the Ralph technique:

### Initialization Phase

1. **User Input** → Generate Spec (using LeanSpec format)
2. **Generate Test Cases** → Jest/Vitest/pytest test files
3. **Define Acceptance Criteria** → Explicit, verifiable conditions for completion
4. **Human Approval** → User reviews and approves Spec + Tests + ACs

### Ralph Loop

```javascript
const maxIterations = 10; // Configurable Ralph/burst limit
let iteration = 0;

while (iteration < maxIterations) {
  // Step 1: Generate/Refine Implementation
  const code = await coder.generate({
    spec: spec,
    previousErrors: errors,
    context: context
  });
  
  // Step 2: Execute Tests
  const result = await executor.run("npm test");
  
  // Step 3: Critic Verification (even if tests pass)
  const verification = await critic.verify({
    spec: spec,
    acceptanceCriteria: acceptanceCriteria,
    code: code,
    testResult: result,
    coverage: result.coverage
  });
  
  // Step 4: Check Verification Result
  if (verification.status === 'complete') {
    console.log("✅ All requirements met and verified!");
    return { 
      success: true, 
      code, 
      iterations: iteration + 1,
      verificationReport: verification.report
    };
  }
  
  // Step 5: Analyze Gap/Failure
  const analysis = verification.analysis; // Contains test errors OR spec gaps
  
  // Step 6: Update Context for Next Iteration
  errors = analysis.refinementPrompt;
  context = { ...context, failureHistory: [...context.failureHistory, analysis] };
  
  iteration++;
}

// Max iterations reached without passing
throw new Error(`Ralph loop failed after ${maxIterations} iterations. Manual intervention required.`);
```

### Loop Cases

* **Case A (Tests Fail):** Capture error logs (stack trace), analyze root cause, generate fix prompt.
* **Case B (Tests Pass, Spec Incomplete):** Tests pass but Critic detects missing requirements/ACs → Generate gap analysis prompt.
* **Case C (Tests Pass, False Positive):** Tests pass but implementation doesn't match spec intent → Refine implementation.
* **Case D (Complete & Verified):** All tests pass AND all spec requirements met → **Exit loop, deliver code**.
* **Case E (Compilation/Syntax Error):** Critic analyzes and suggests fixes.
* **Case F (Max Iterations):** Reached limit without completion → **Error and require manual intervention**.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why "Ralph Mode" (Burst Mode)?

**Origin**: The Ralph technique was created by Geoffrey Huntley as an autonomous AI development pattern. The name "Ralph" refers to Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, representing deterministic behavior in an undeterministic world. See [ghuntley.com/ralph](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) and [frankbria/ralph-claude-code](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code).

**Traditional Workflow Problems:**
- After AI generates code, humans manually run tests
- After finding errors, need to manually describe issues back to AI
- Multiple round-trips, low efficiency, unstable quality
- False positives: "tests pass" doesn't guarantee spec completion

**Ralph Mode Advantages:**
- Automated PDCA cycle with no human intervention (like Ralph's `while` loop)
- System automatically captures and analyzes errors
- Continuous iteration until verified complete or max iterations reached
- Critic prevents false positives by verifying spec compliance
- Inspired by battle-tested ralph-claude-code implementation (v0.9.8, 276 passing tests)

### 2. Sandbox Execution Environment

**Security Requirements:**
- Code may contain malicious instructions or infinite loops
- Need isolated execution environment (Docker/VM)
- Resource limits (CPU/memory/time)

**Implementation Options:**
```yaml
Option 1: Docker Container
  Pros: Strong isolation, cross-platform
  Cons: Slow startup (~2-3s per iteration)

Option 2: VM2 (Node.js Sandbox)
  Pros: Fast startup (~100ms)
  Cons: JavaScript only, weaker isolation

Option 3: WebAssembly
  Pros: Near-native performance, secure
  Cons: Ecosystem not mature
```

**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid mode
- Use lightweight sandbox (VM2/Deno) for initial iterations
- Use Docker for verification when nearing completion

### 3. Critic Verification Strategy

The Critic is a **two-phase verification engine**: Test Analysis + Spec Verification.

#### Phase 1: Test Analysis (when tests fail)

| Error Type       | Analysis Strategy                                          | Example                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax Error** | Extract line number and error message                      | `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' at line 42`     |
| **Type Error**   | Analyze type mismatch, suggest type correction             | `TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined` |
| **Logic Error**  | Compare expected vs actual values, infer logic issues      | `Expected: [1,2,3], Received: [1,2,2]`             |
| **Timeout**      | Identify potential infinite loops, suggest exit conditions | `Test exceeded 5000ms timeout`                     |

#### Phase 2: Spec Verification (always runs)

Even when tests pass, verify:

| Check Type               | Verification Method                                    | Prevents                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Requirement Coverage** | Map spec requirements to code implementation           | Incomplete features                      |
| **AC Compliance**        | Validate each acceptance criterion is met              | Partial implementations                  |
| **Functionality Gaps**   | Compare spec intent vs actual behavior                 | Tests that don't cover all scenarios     |
| **False Positives**      | Cross-reference test assertions with spec requirements | Passing tests that miss key requirements |
| **Edge Cases**           | Verify boundary conditions mentioned in spec           | Brittle implementations                  |

**Enhanced Techniques:**
- **Semantic Diff:** Compare code changes to judge fix effectiveness
- **Pattern Matching:** Identify common error patterns (e.g., off-by-one)
- **Context Retention:** Retain failure history to avoid repeated errors
- **Requirement Tracing:** Track each spec requirement to its implementation
- **AC Checklist:** Maintain explicit checklist of acceptance criteria
- **Intent Matching:** Use AI to verify code matches spec intent, not just mechanics

### 4. Context Economy

Token consumption per iteration:

```
Iteration 1: Spec (2k) + Test Suite (1k) + ACs (0.5k) + Prompt (0.5k) = 4k tokens
Iteration 2: Spec (2k) + Test Suite (1k) + ACs (0.5k) + Error Log (0.5k) + Prompt (0.5k) = 4.5k tokens
Iteration N: Spec (2k) + Test Suite (1k) + ACs (0.5k) + Verification Report (1k) + Prompt (0.5k) = 5.5k tokens
```

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Error Log Compression:** Keep only last 3 failures' stack traces
- **Incremental Updates:** Pass code diffs instead of full code
- **Smart Truncation:** Auto-remove old error records when exceeding 10k tokens
- **AC Checklist Format:** Use compact checklist format instead of verbose descriptions
- **Verification Summaries:** Compress verification reports to essential gaps only

## Open Questions

1. **How to handle tests requiring human judgment?** (e.g., UI tests, visual regression tests)
   - Possible solution: Provide "human verification" step, pause Burst for confirmation

2. **Should we support incremental testing?** (run only failed tests, not entire suite)
   - Advantage: Save time
   - Risk: May introduce new errors

3. **How to integrate with Git?**
   - Create commit per iteration?
   - Commit only after verification complete?

4. **How to handle ambiguous acceptance criteria?**
   - Require human clarification mid-burst?
   - Use AI to infer intent with confidence scores?

5. **When should Critic be strict vs lenient?**
   - Balance between completeness and pragmatism
   - Different modes for different project types?

6. **How does `--ralph`/`--burst` flag interact with other agent options?**
   - Can Ralph mode work with `--parallel` (worktrees)?
   - Should Ralph mode auto-enable certain agents (e.g., Claude for best reasoning)?
   - How to handle Ralph mode in cloud agents (gh-coding)?
   - Can we learn from ralph-claude-code's session management and circuit breaker patterns?
