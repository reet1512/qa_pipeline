# LeanSpec Dogfooding: Real SDD Case Studies

> **Status**: ✅ Complete · **Priority**: High · **Created**: 2025-11-17

**Project**: lean-spec  
**Team**: Core Development

## Overview

Users need real-world examples of SDD in action. LeanSpec project itself uses SDD extensively - showcase this to demonstrate practical value and best practices.

**Problem**:
- Users see LeanSpec has 90+ specs but don't see how they were actually used
- No examples of spec evolution during development
- Missing "show, don't tell" evidence that SDD works

**Goal**: Create case studies documenting how specific LeanSpec features were built using SDD:

1. **Simple Feature Case Study** (spec 071 - Simplified Token Validation)
   - Small, focused spec
   - Show spec → implementation → completion flow
   - Demonstrate single-concern spec

2. **Complex Feature Case Study** (spec 082 - Web Realtime Sync Architecture)
   - Large, multi-phase spec
   - Show how spec evolved during implementation
   - Demonstrate sub-spec usage and complexity management

3. **Refactoring Case Study** (spec 067 - Monorepo Core Extraction)
   - Breaking change requiring careful planning
   - Show dependency analysis and coordination
   - Demonstrate spec-driven refactoring

4. **Cross-Team Feature** (spec 043 - Official Launch 02)
   - Multiple related specs
   - Show spec relationships and dependencies
   - Demonstrate team coordination

**Each case study includes**:
- Original spec content
- Implementation approach
- Challenges encountered
- How spec helped (or needed updates)
- Lessons learned

## Design

**Case study structure**:

1. **Context**: What problem were we solving?
2. **The Spec**: Link to actual spec, show key sections
3. **Implementation**: How we built it
4. **Evolution**: What changed during development
5. **Outcome**: Final result, metrics
6. **Lessons**: What worked, what we'd do differently
7. **AI Agent Collaboration**: How AI agents used the spec

**Selection criteria for case studies**:
- Completed specs (status: complete or archived)
- Representative of common use cases
- Various complexity levels (simple → complex)
- Different spec types (feature, refactor, architecture)
- Show both successes and challenges

**Presentation**:
- Create "Case Studies" section in docs-site
- Each case study = separate page
- Include screenshots/diagrams where helpful
- Link to actual spec in GitHub
- Show before/after code where relevant

**Anti-patterns to avoid**:
- Cherry-picking only perfect examples
- Hiding challenges or mistakes
- Making it look effortless (be honest about iteration)

## Plan

**Phase 1: Case study selection**
- [ ] Review completed specs, identify good candidates
- [ ] Select 4 specs covering different scenarios
- [ ] Gather context: git history, PR discussions, implementation details

**Phase 2: Case study writing**
- [ ] Write Simple Feature case study (spec 071)
- [ ] Write Complex Feature case study (spec 082)
- [ ] Write Refactoring case study (spec 067)
- [ ] Write Cross-Team Feature case study (spec 043)

**Phase 3: Integration**
- [ ] Create "Case Studies" section in docs-site
- [ ] Add case study navigation
- [ ] Link from homepage/getting started
- [ ] Add "How LeanSpec uses SDD" overview page

**Phase 4: Maintenance**
- [ ] Add more case studies over time (target: 1 per quarter)
- [ ] Update case studies as specs evolve
- [ ] Collect user feedback on case studies

## Test

- [ ] Users report understanding SDD better after reading case studies
- [ ] Case studies demonstrate concrete value of SDD (not just theory)
- [ ] Both successes and challenges are clearly documented
- [ ] Users can relate case studies to their own projects
- [ ] Case studies cover range of scenarios (simple to complex)
