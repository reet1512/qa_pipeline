# Documentation Information Architecture v2

> **Status**: ✅ Complete · **Priority**: High · **Created**: 2025-11-08 · **Tags**: docs, information-architecture, ux, v0.2.0

**Project**: lean-spec  
**Team**: Core Development

## Overview

Restructure docs-site to cleanly separate **WHY (Core Concepts)** from **HOW (Getting Started/Usage)**, eliminate conceptual confusion, and create clear, progressive learning pathways for users.

**Current Problem**: Documentation mixes WHY and HOW, lacks clear basic commands documentation, and has redundant/misplaced sections.

**Solution**: Restructure with clear separation - Core Concepts (WHY) → Usage (HOW with progressive disclosure: basic → advanced).

**Why This Matters**: Users need a clear mental model for learning and using LeanSpec effectively.

## Summary

**Key Changes:**
1. **Core Concepts** - Pure WHY (positioning, principles, philosophy) + new Context Engineering and AI Agent Memory pages
2. **Remove "Working with AI"** - Integrate throughout (setup in Getting Started, usage in new AI-Assisted section)
3. **Unified Usage Section** - Merge Features + Workflow, add missing Essential Usage docs, organize progressively
4. **Navigation Flow** - Intro → Core Concepts → Usage (basic → project mgmt → advanced → AI) → Reference

**Result**: Clear progressive learning path, comprehensive basic commands documentation, no confusion about where to find information.

## Details

See sub-specs for comprehensive design:

- **[PROBLEM-ANALYSIS.md](./PROBLEM-ANALYSIS.md)** - Current structure issues and user confusion points
- **[SOLUTION-DESIGN.md](./SOLUTION-DESIGN.md)** - New information architecture and navigation flow
- **[PAGE-SPECIFICATIONS.md](./PAGE-SPECIFICATIONS.md)** - Detailed page content specifications
- **[IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)** - 11-phase implementation plan with tasks

cd .. && npx lean-spec validate

# Check for broken links (if link checker available)
# npm run check-links
```

## Notes

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Why keep "Understanding LeanSpec" as entry point but add Context Engineering + AI Agent Memory?**
- "Understanding LeanSpec" is more informative than abrupt "Why LeanSpec"
- Users need quick overview before diving into detailed concepts
- Context Engineering coherently links to spec 059 and Context Economy principle
- AI Agent Memory connects to broader research (LangChain) and positions specs as persistent memory
- Each concept gets dedicated page for depth

**2. Why remove "Working with AI" section?**
- AI is not optional add-on, it's core to LeanSpec
- Setup belongs in Getting Started (everyone needs it)
- Patterns/best practices belong in Usage (how to use)
- Having separate section implies AI is secondary concern

**3. Why merge Features + Workflow into Usage?**
- Both are "how to use LeanSpec features"
- Artificial separation confuses users
- New structure is progressive: Basic → Project Mgmt → Advanced → AI
- Natural learning progression

**4. Why "Essential Usage" instead of "Basic Commands"?**
- "Essential" is more accurate - these are core operations, not just "basic"
- Covers both commands AND concepts (spec structure, frontmatter)
- Better conveys importance to new users
- Each page includes cross-links to detailed Reference documentation
- Critical gap filled - fundamental operations clearly documented

### Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1-2 (Core Concepts + new pages)**: 4-5 hours
- **Phase 3-7 (Usage)**: 5-6 hours
- **Phase 8-11 (Navigation + Testing)**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 11-14 hours over 2-3 days

### Research Sources

**Context Engineering**:
- Spec 059: Programmatic Spec Management & Context Engineering
- Spec 059/CONTEXT-ENGINEERING.md: Deep dive on strategies and failure modes
- Anthropic: [Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)
- LangChain: [Context Engineering for Agents](https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/)
- Drew Breunig: [How Contexts Fail and How to Fix Them](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html)

**AI Agent Memory**:
- LangChain: [Memory for Agents](https://blog.langchain.com/memory-for-agents/)
- CoALA paper: [Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02427)
- Key insight: Specs serve as **semantic memory** (long-term knowledge store) for AI agents
- MCP integration enables memory retrieval in AI chat context

### Related Specs

- **Spec 060**: Core Concepts Coherence (created 12 patterns approach)
- **Spec 059**: Programmatic Spec Management & Context Engineering (source for Context Engineering concept)
- **Spec 058**: Comprehensive docs restructure (previous iteration)
- **Spec 049**: LeanSpec First Principles (foundation for First Principles page)
- **Spec 043**: v0.2.0 launch (this blocks launch)

### Trade-offs

**Lose**:
- Separate "Working with AI" navigation entry
- "Features" and "Workflow" as distinct categories

**Gain**:
- Crystal clear WHY vs HOW separation
- Progressive learning path
- No redundancy or confusion
- Comprehensive basic commands docs
- Logical feature grouping (basic → advanced)

**5. Why add Context Engineering and AI Agent Memory as core concepts?**
- Both are fundamental to understanding LeanSpec's innovation
- Context Engineering: Connects to spec 059, explains practical application of Context Economy
- AI Agent Memory: Positions specs as persistent memory layer (research-backed from LangChain)
- Both coherently link to First Principles and differentiate LeanSpec from traditional approaches
- Elevates discussion from "how to write specs" to "how AI agents use specs"

**6. Why add cross-links to Reference pages throughout Usage?**
- Reduces redundancy - Usage guides the "what/why", Reference documents the "how/details"
- Users can quickly jump to detailed API/config documentation
- Maintains clear separation between guidance and reference material
- Follows documentation best practices (guide → reference pattern)

**Rationale**: Users need clear mental models. WHY (positioning/principles) vs HOW (usage) is the fundamental distinction. Context Engineering and AI Agent Memory strengthen the WHY by connecting to research and implementation. Cross-linking creates cohesive documentation. Everything else flows from that.
