## Specs that fit in AI working memory

Traditional 2,000-line RFCs overflow AI context windows. Your AI agent can't help because it can't fit the full context.

```diff
- Heavyweight process (multi-step workflows) → AI context overflow
- Vibe coding (no specs) → Team misalignment
+ LeanSpec: Structure without overhead
```

**LeanSpec: A lean SDD methodology for human + AI collaboration.**

Specs under 300 lines. Intent-focused. Machine-readable. Adapts to your workflow—from solo dev to enterprise.

*Lean = adaptive and progressive. Tools (CLI/MCP) support the methodology.*

## The SDD Dilemma

### Scenario 1: Context Overflow 🔴

You paste a traditional spec into Cursor. **"Context too large."** Your AI agent can't help—it can't fit the full context. Back to manual implementation.

### Scenario 2: Stale Documentation 📄

Your team has beautiful specs. None match the current code. Nobody updates them because it's too painful. They're documentation theater.

### Scenario 3: Wrong Tool for the Job ⚖️

You tried automated code generation tools—powerful but heavyweight. You tried vibe coding—fast but team gets misaligned. Where's the **lightweight spec methodology**?

**LeanSpec solves this:**
- ✅ Specs fit in AI context windows (<300 lines)
- ✅ Structured enough for AI agents to understand
- ✅ Flexible enough to grow with your team
- ✅ CLI & MCP tools to support the workflow

---

## How LeanSpec is Different

**From Automated Tools (like [Spec Kit](https://github.com/speckai/speckai)):**
- ❌ No multi-step workflows or slash commands
- ❌ No code generation or task execution
- ✅ Just specs for team alignment and AI context

**From Lightweight Approaches (vibe coding):**
- ❌ Not "just chat with AI"
- ✅ Enough structure for AI agents to act on
- ✅ Team alignment through shared specs
- ✅ Maintainable documentation

**From Change-Tracking Systems (like [OpenSpec](https://github.com/openspec-dev/openspec)):**
- ❌ No proposals or change folders
- ❌ No diff-based workflows
- ✅ Direct spec editing with version control
- ✅ Philosophy over process

**LeanSpec = Just the specs.** Markdown files with structure. No ceremony, no overhead.

## How It Works

### A Real LeanSpec in Action

Here's an actual spec from this project (287 lines):

```yaml
---
status: in-progress
created: 2025-11-01
tags: [cli, dx]
priority: high
---

# Unified Dashboard

## Overview
Combine `lean-spec board` and `lean-spec stats` into a single, comprehensive
project health view. Give users instant insight into project status,
bottlenecks, and team velocity.

## Design
- Board view (Kanban columns)
- Key metrics (completion rate, avg spec size)
- Bottleneck detection (specs >400 lines, stale specs)
- Health score (0-100)

## Plan
1. Merge board + stats logic
2. Add health scoring algorithm
3. Implement bottleneck detection
4. Add color-coded indicators

## Success Criteria
- Shows full project state in <5 seconds
- Identifies bottlenecks automatically
- Used daily by team leads
```

**Notice:**
- ✅ Under 300 lines (fits in AI + human working memory)
- ✅ Intent is clear ("what" and "why")
- ✅ Implementation details are minimal (not a PRD)
- ✅ Both human and AI can understand
- ✅ Structured metadata (status, tags, priority)

---

## Built on First Principles

LeanSpec isn't arbitrary rules—it's derived from fundamental constraints of working with AI.

### 🧠 Context Economy
**Specs <300 lines → Fit in working memory**

- **Physics**: AI context windows are bounded (~20K effective tokens)
- **Biology**: Human working memory is limited (7±2 items)
- **Economics**: Large contexts cost more time and money
- **Result**: Keep specs under 300 lines, split complex features

### ✂️ Signal-to-Noise Maximization
**Every word informs decisions → Or it's cut**

- Every sentence must answer: "What decision does this inform?"
- Cut obvious statements, inferable content, speculation
- Keep decision rationale, constraints, success criteria
- **Result**: Dense, actionable specs that respect reader attention

### 📈 Progressive Disclosure
**Add structure only when you feel pain → Start simple**

- Solo dev: Just `status` + `created`
- Small team: Add `tags` + `priority`
- Enterprise: Add custom fields as needed
- **Result**: Structure adapts to team, not the other way around

### 🎯 Intent Over Implementation
**Capture "why" → Let "how" emerge**

- Must have: Problem, intent, success criteria
- Should have: Design rationale, trade-offs
- Could have: Implementation details (these change)
- **Result**: Specs stay relevant as code evolves

### 🌉 Bridge the Gap
**Both humans AND AI must understand → Clear structure + natural language**

- For humans: Overview, context, rationale
- For AI: Unambiguous requirements, structured metadata
- Both can parse and reason about specs
- **Result**: True human-AI collaboration

---

**These aren't preferences—they're constraints.** Physics (context windows), biology (working memory), and economics (token costs) dictate what works.

```

Custom fields fully supported. Adapts to your workflow as you grow.

### ⚡ Actually Maintainable

**The problem:** Traditional specs get stale because updating them is too painful.

**LeanSpec solution:**
- **Short specs** - Fits in AI context window for easy updates
- **CLI tools** - Quick viewing and editing from terminal
- **AI-friendly format** - Structured markdown AI agents can parse and update
- **Version control** - Git tracks changes, diffs show what evolved

**Result:** Specs light enough to actually keep in sync with code.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install & Initialize

```bash
npm install -g lean-spec
cd your-project
lean-spec init
```

### 2. Work with Your AI Tool

**In Cursor, Copilot, or any AI coding assistant:**

```
👤 You: "Create a spec for user authentication with OAuth2."

🤖 AI: [runs lean-spec create user-authentication]
      "I've created specs/001-user-authentication/README.md.
      Here's the spec..."

👤 You: "Now implement the OAuth2 flow based on this spec."

🤖 AI: [reads spec, implements code]
      "I've implemented the OAuth2 provider in src/auth/oauth.ts..."
```

### 3. Track Progress

```bash
# Check project status
lean-spec board

# View spec with AI-friendly output
lean-spec view user-authentication --json

# Update status as you progress
lean-spec update user-authentication --status in-progress
```

**The workflow:**
1. ✅ Ask AI to create spec (it uses `lean-spec create`)
2. ✅ AI reads spec and implements (spec fits in context)
3. ✅ Track with `lean-spec board` / `lean-spec stats`
4. ✅ Update status as work progresses

**Why this works:**
- Specs <300 lines → Fit in AI context window
- Structured format → AI can parse and act on
- CLI tools → AI knows how to use them
- You drive, AI executes

## We Practice What We Preach

**LeanSpec is built using LeanSpec.** Every feature, refactor, and design decision has a spec. All specs follow the first principles—under 300 lines, AI-readable, actively maintained.

**Real velocity from zero to official launch:**
- **6 days** from first commit to production
- Full-featured CLI, MCP server, documentation site
- 54 specs written and implemented—all with AI agents
- Derived first principles from practicing LeanSpec 

We dogfood our own methodology. Specs that fit in AI context enable the velocity we promise.

## When to Use (and Skip) Specs

| Use LeanSpec When: | Skip It When: |
|---------------------|---------------|
| ✅ Features span multiple files/components | ❌ Trivial bug fixes |
| ✅ Architecture decisions need alignment | ❌ Self-explanatory refactors |
| ✅ Guiding AI agents on complex features | ❌ Pure API reference (use code comments) |
| ✅ Design rationale should be documented | ❌ Quick experiments |
| ✅ Team needs to coordinate work | ❌ Changes are obvious |

**Philosophy:** Write specs when they add clarity. Skip them when they don't.
