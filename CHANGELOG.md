## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Dynamic Schema Enrichment** ([issue #274](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/issues/274)) — Long-running processes now reuse a resolved adapter across requests instead of re-issuing schema enrichment network calls per hit. New `AdapterCache` in `leanspec-core` holds the resolved `Arc<dyn Adapter>` per project root with a 5-minute TTL; the HTTP server exposes `POST /api/projects/{id}/schema/refresh` to flush a project's cache on demand, the MCP server adds a `reload_schema` tool that re-resolves the active adapter without restarting, and `leanspec capabilities` accepts `--refresh` (informational for the single-shot CLI). Adapter enrichment failures are now warnings on stderr, not fatal — offline / bad-token sessions fall back to the static schema defaults instead of aborting.
- **`leanspec init --adapter github`** ([issue #263](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/issues/263)) — Initialize a GitHub Issues-backed project from the CLI: detects the GitHub remote, validates `$GITHUB_TOKEN` via `GET /user`, writes `leanspec.adapter.yaml`, and installs an adapter-agnostic `AGENTS.md`. Stubs for `--adapter ado` / `--adapter jira` print a "coming soon" message.
- **TUI Multi-Project Management** ([spec 372](https://web.lean-spec.dev/specs/372)) — Switch between and manage multiple projects from the TUI
- **TUI Sidebar Navigation & Tree View** ([spec 371](https://web.lean-spec.dev/specs/371)) — Sidebar with sort/filter controls and hierarchical tree view for specs
- **TUI Board View Enhancements** — Collapsible board groups with sort indicator, TOC overlay, and scrollbars
- **TUI Vertical Scrollbars** — Scrollbar widgets in list, board, and detail views
- **TUI Theme Overhaul** — Modern theme with Unicode symbols and RGB color palette
- **Configurable Project Sources** — Local and GitHub project sources via capabilities endpoint
- **GitHub Tab in Create Dialog** — New UI entry point for importing GitHub projects on mobile

### Changed
- **Default TUI View** — Default view changed from Board to List
- **MCP Deprecation** — Removed MCP integration and deprecated `leanspec-mcp` package

### Fixed
- **TUI Mouse Scroll** — Routes mouse scroll events by cursor position instead of keyboard focus
- **Mobile Blank Page** — Fixes blank page on custom domain for mobile web
- **Clippy Lints** — Resolves `map_or` → `is_some_and` and redundant else branch warnings

### Technical
- **CI Speed-Up** — Removes `--test-threads=1` constraint and skips session tests for faster builds
- **MCP Test Cleanup** — Ignores MCP config test (feature deprecated)
- Adds specs 372–377 covering project management, UX defaults, real-time file watch, spec editing, and testing infrastructure

### Philosophy & Methodology

This release operationalizes LeanSpec's five first principles:

1. **Context Economy** - Fit in working memory (<300 lines target, 400 max)
2. **Signal-to-Noise Maximization** - Every word informs decisions
3. **Intent Over Implementation** - Capture why, not just how
4. **Bridge the Gap** - Both human and AI understand
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Add complexity only when pain is felt

**Practice What We Preach:**
- All specs validated against principles
- Large specs split using sub-spec pattern
- Documentation follows progressive disclosure
- Validation tooling prevents principle violations

### Migration Notes

**From v0.1.x:**
- Run `lean-spec validate` to check your specs
- Review any specs >400 lines and consider splitting
- Update to new validate output format (ESLint-style)
- No breaking changes to commands or file formats

**From other tools:**
- Use `lean-spec migrate` for ADRs, RFCs, design docs
- See documentation for detailed migration guides
- AI-assisted migration available (Claude, Copilot)

### Acknowledgments

### Philosophy

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-10

### Changed

**BREAKING: Command and directory naming migration**
- **Command name**: `lspec` → `lean-spec` (full name for clarity and consistency)
- **Config directory**: `.lspec/` → `.lean-spec/` (matches package and command name)
- **Binary**: Only `lean-spec` command available (removed `lspec` alias)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistency: Package name, command, and config directory all use `lean-spec`
- ✅ Clarity: `npx lean-spec` works immediately (matches npm package name)
- ✅ Simplicity: Single command to remember, no abbreviations

**Migration Guide for Existing Users:**

1. **Uninstall old version:**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g lean-spec
   ```

2. **Install new version:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g lean-spec
   ```

3. **Update existing projects:**
   ```bash
   # Rename config directory
   mv .lspec .lean-spec
   ```

4. **Update commands:**
   - Old: `lspec init` → New: `lean-spec init`
   - Old: `lspec board` → New: `lean-spec board`
   - Old: `npx lspec` → New: `npx lean-spec`

**All documentation, examples, and specs updated to reflect new naming.**

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-07

### Changed

**BREAKING: `lspec validate` output format redesigned** ([spec 54](https://web.lean-spec.dev/specs/54))
- Output now follows mainstream lint tool conventions (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier)
- File-centric grouping: All issues for a spec are shown together
- Quiet success by default: Only specs with issues are shown, passing specs are summarized
- ESLint-style format: Aligned columns with `severity  message  rule-name`
- Relative paths shown instead of absolute paths
- Exit codes remain unchanged: 0 for success/warnings, 1 for errors

### Added

**`lspec validate` new flags:**
- `--verbose`: Show all passing specs (restores detailed output)
- `--quiet`: Suppress warnings, only show errors
- `--format json`: Output results as JSON for CI integration
- `--rule <name>`: Filter issues by specific rule (e.g., `max-lines`, `frontmatter`)

**Migration Guide:**
- If you prefer the old verbose output, use `lspec validate --verbose`
- The new default shows only specs with issues for better signal-to-noise ratio
- Exit codes are unchanged, so CI pipelines should work without modification
- JSON format is available for custom parsing: `lspec validate --format json`

### Fixed
- Fixed potential crash in validate formatter when spec name is missing

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added

**Core Features:**
- CLI tool with comprehensive command set (`init`, `create`, `list`, `search`, `update`, `archive`, `files`, `templates`)
- Project initialization with three built-in templates (minimal, standard, enterprise)
- Spec creation with automatic directory structure and frontmatter
- Frontmatter support with status tracking, tags, priority, and custom fields
- Full-text search across specs using fuzzy matching
- Dependency tracking between specs

**Visualization & Organization:**
- `lspec board` - Kanban-style board view with status columns
- `lspec stats` - Work distribution and completion analytics
- `lspec timeline` - Chronological view of spec creation
- `lspec gantt` - Gantt chart visualization (requires mermaid-cli)
- `lspec deps` - Dependency graph visualization

**Developer Experience:**
- Interactive prompts for all commands

- Spinner animations for long operations
- Table-based displays for list views
- React-based UI components (Ink)
